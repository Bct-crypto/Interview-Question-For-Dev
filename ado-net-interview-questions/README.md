## 1. What is _ADO.NET_ and what are its main components?

**ADO.NET** is a set of libraries in .NET that provide data access services, functioning as bridge between your code and various data sources such as SQL Server, XML, and more.

### Main Components:

1. **Data Providers**: Unique data providers are used for different data sources. For instance, `SqlClient` is specific to SQL Server, `OleDb` serves older databases, and `ODBC` helps with universal database connections. These providers optimize performance for their respective data sources.

2. **DataSets and Data Tables**: These in-memory data structures handle disconnected data management. **Data Adapters** synchronize data between datasets and the original data source. When modifications are made in-memory, the changes can be propagated back to the data source.

3. **Commands**: The `Command` object is central to most data interactions. It's used to execute SQL or stored procedure commands against the data source. There are three types of commands - `CommandText`, `StoredProcedure`, and `TableDirect`.

   - **CommandText**: Uses direct SQL queries to interact with the data.
   - **StoredProcedure**: Executes pre-defined stored procedures.
   - **TableDirect**: Binds the command object directly to the table.

4. **Connections**: The `Connection` object establishes and terminates connections to the data source. As with commands, different data providers involve different connection objects.

5. **DataReaders**: Often leveraged for read-only access to data during high-speed, forward-only navigations. These objects do not store whole sets of data in memory, making them fast and efficient, especially for large records. Use the `ExecuteReader` method through a command object to get a `DataReader` object.

6. **Transactions**: The `Transaction` object ensures that a set of actions either all succeed or all fail.

7. **Parameterized Queries**: A security feature used to protect against SQL Injection Attacks. It ensures that query parameters are treated as constants, not part of the SQL command structure.
<br>

## 2. How does _ADO.NET_ differ from classic _ADO_?

**ADO.NET** represents a significant advancement over its predecessor, **ADO**. It addresses several limitations and introduces modern features that notably enhance database interaction.

### Key Improvements of ADO.NET over ADO

#### Disconnected Data Model

- **ADO.NET**: Data is managed using DataSets and DataTables in a disconnected manner, reducing resource consumption and enabling offline data editing.
- **ADO**: Operates primarily in a connected mode, relying on references to live data sources.

#### Multi-Table Data Handling

- **ADO.NET**: Through DataRelations, DataSets can manage multiple tables.
- **ADO**: While possible, handling multi-table relationships is cumbersome.

#### Data Binding

- **ADO.NET** DataBinding simplifies linking UI components such as grids to data sources.
- **ADO**: Lacks robust out-of-the-box support for fast UI updates and data source sync.

#### Version-Dependent

- **ADO.NET**: Introduced as part of the .NET Framework, ADO.NET is tailored to modern Windows platforms.
- **ADO**: More universal, with support ranging from earlier versions of Windows to Linux and macOS through technologies like *Wine*.

#### XML Integration

- **ADO.NET**: Employs XML natively for data interchange and storage, whereas **ADO** doesn't have built-in XML support.
- **ADO**: Lacks robust native XML support, relying on COM-based extensions like ADO MD.

#### Efficiency

- **ADO.NET**: Incorporates various optimization features, like better use of connection pooling, enhancing performance over ADO.
- **ADO**: Often needing explicit opening and closing of resource objects, ADO can be less efficient in resource usage.
<br>

## 3. What is the role of the _DataSet_ in _ADO.NET_?

The **DataSet** is a key component of ADO.NET, serving as an in-memory cache that can hold multiple related DataTables and supporting data relationships. This disconnected approach reduces the need for repeated database trips, boosting efficiency.

### Benefits of Using DataSets

1. **Disconnected Data Handling**: By removing the need for a continual database connection, DataSets enhance both security and performance.

2. **Integration Support**: DataSets readily integrate with UI components like data grids and can serve as data sources for objects within the business layer.

3. **Data Versioning and Control**: Accurate tracking of data changes is achievable.

4. **Data Bound Control Flexibility**: DataSets offer flexibility in data binding, which is especially useful when dealing with complex data structures.

5. **Cross-Table Operations**: DataSets can merge, validate, and compare multiple tables simultaneously.

6. **Inherent Data Serialization**: DataSets are designed to serialize easily, making them ideal for use in web services.

7. **Data Management and Validation**: Actions like data grouping, sorting, and validating data against constraints are straightforward with DataSets.

### When Not to Use DataSets

While DataSets are versatile and efficient for a broad range of data management tasks, they might not always be the best choice. In scenarios where:

- **Real-time Data Operations** are the priority, and resource constraints allow frequent database calls.
- **Complex Data Mappings** are involved, which can be difficult to handle with a disconnected model.
- There's a need for **Lower Memory Footprint and Performance**. In some cases, using lightweight models like DataReaders might be more suitable.
<br>

## 4. Explain the differences between _DataSet_ and _DataReader_.

Let's compare two important **ADO.NET** components: the **DataSet** and the **DataReader**.

### DataSet

The **DataSet** represents an in-memory cache of data, offering tabular organization with **DataTables**.

- **Two-way Interaction**: The DataSet supports both read and write operations.
- **Disconncted Environment**: Data can be kept in the DataSet after the initial connection closes, offering offline access and modification.
- **Consistency Checks**: It ensures referential integrity and data disorders through the use of DataRelations.
- **Versatility**: Supports different types of data manipulation with its integrated Full Command and DataAdapter.
- **Data Abstraction**: Simplifies access patterns and makes data-supplier specific attributes invisible.

### DataReader

The **DataReader** provides a read-only, forward-only stream, delivering data directly from the database.

- **Speed and Efficiency**: Due to its sequential read nature, the DataReader is quicker and consumes fewer resources.
- **Real-time Access**: It retrieves data from the database on-the-fly, making it a better choice for large result sets and scenarios where data volatility is high.
- **Live Cursors**: It ensures up-to-the-moment data, beneficial when dealing with contemporary or changing data.

### Commonalities

Both interfaces are integral to the ADO.NET workflow and relate to data access. They're provided by data providers for data stores.
<br>

## 5. What are the key _classes_ in _ADO.NET_?

**ADO.NET**, part of the .NET Framework, facilitates data access. Its key classes are `DataSet`, `DataTable`, `DataRelation`, `DataView`, `DataColumn`, `DataRow`, and `DataAdapter`. It integrates a provider-based model to interact with various data sources.

### Core Concepts

#### DataSet and DataTables: In-Memory Data

**DataSet**: A virtual container representing an in-memory database, including a collection of DataTables, DataRelations, and other schema information.
  
Code Example:  
```csharp
    DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();
```

**DataTable**: Corresponds to a table of an actual database and is found inside the DataSet. It contains DataColumn collections to manage columns and DataRow collections to handle table rows.

Code Example:  
```csharp
    DataTable dataTable = new DataTable();
    dataSet.Tables.Add(dataTable);
```

#### DataViews: Sorted and Filtered Views

**DataView**: Provides a view of a DataTable with schema data, filter, and sort criteria. This is used to display or process data in a specific sorted or filtered order without altering the original data.

Code Example:  
```csharp
    DataView dataView = new DataView(dataTable);
    dataView.Sort = "ColumnName ASC";
```

#### Relationships

**DataRelation**: Defines a relationship between two DataTables. It links a key column from the parent DataTable to a foreign key column in the child DataTable.
  
Code Example:  
```csharp
    DataColumn parentColumn = parentTable.Columns["keyColumn"];
    DataColumn childColumn = childTable.Columns["foreignKeyColumn"];
    DataRelation relation = new DataRelation("relationName", parentColumn, childColumn);
    dataSet.Relations.Add(relation);
```

#### Data Adapters: DataSet - Database Synchronization

**DataAdapter**: Acts as a bridge between the DataSet and source database. It populates the DataTables within a DataSet and conveys changes made in-memory back to the database. It comprises `Command` objects for interacting with the database like `SelectCommand`, `InsertCommand`, `UpdateCommand`, and `DeleteCommand`.

Code Example:  
```csharp
    SqlConnection sqlConnection = new SqlConnection("connectionString");
    SqlDataAdapter dataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT * FROM table", sqlConnection);
```

#### DataRows

**DataRow**: Represents a single row within a DataTable. When working with DataRows directly, you can use methods such as `Delete`, `SetAdded`, `SetModified`, and `SetUnchanged`.
  
Code Example:  
```csharp
    DataRow newRow = table.NewRow();
    newRow["Column1"] = "Value1";
    newRow["Column2"] = 2;
    table.Rows.Add(newRow);
```

#### DataColumn: Schema Definition

**DataColumn**: Represents the schema of a column in a DataTable, including attributes such as name, data type, and constraints.
  
Code Example:  
```csharp
    DataColumn newColumn = new DataColumn("ColumnName", typeof(int));
    table.Columns.Add(newColumn);
```

### Code Example: DataSet and DataAdapter

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string connectionString = "YourConnectionString";
        string query = "SELECT * FROM YourTable";

        DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();
        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            SqlDataAdapter dataAdapter = new SqlDataAdapter(query, connection);
            dataAdapter.Fill(dataSet, "YourTable");

            DataTable table = dataSet.Tables["YourTable"];
            foreach (DataRow row in table.Rows)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(row["YourColumn"]);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
<br>

## 6. What is the use of the _Connection_ object in _ADO.NET_?

The **ADO.NET** `Connection` object establishes a link with the data source, playing an essential role in all data access operations.

### Key Functions

- **Establishing a Connection**: Initializes a link to the data source, often through implicit or explicit credential authentication.

- **Controlling Transactions**: Enables creating, committing, and rolling back transactions when working with data.

- **Managing Connection State**: Users can check the connection state and manually open or close a connection.

- **Providing Data Source Information**: The connection object stores details such as the server's location or the database name.

### Best Practices

- **Avoid Long-Lived Connections**: Keep the connection open for the shortest duration required. Use connection pooling to efficiently manage connection resources.

- **Use `using` or `Dispose()`**: Ensure proper resource disposal by encapsulating connections within `using` blocks or calling `Dispose()` explicitly.

- **Parameterized Commands for Security**: Leverage parameterized queries to guard against SQL injection.

- **Error and Exception Handling**: Surround data operations that involve a connection with appropriate error handling to ensure graceful behavior in case of faults.

### Code Example: Establishing a Connection

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection("[Your Connection String Here]"))
{
    connection.Open();

    // Perform data operations

    connection.Close();
}
```
<br>

## 7. How do you handle _transactions_ in _ADO.NET_?

**Transactions** in ADO.NET provide a way to ensure **data integrity** by supporting the "all or nothing" principle.

### Types of Transactions

- **Explicit Transactions**: Execute a set of commands together.
  
- **AutoCommit Mode**: This mode can be disabled to form an explicit transaction.

### Core Components

- **Connection**: Links to the database.
- **Command**: Executes SQL or stored procedures.
- **Transaction**: Defines the boundaries for the units of work.

### Code Example: Using Transactions in ADO.NET

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();

    // Start a new transaction
    SqlTransaction transaction = connection.BeginTransaction();

    try
    {
        // Assign the transaction to commands before executing them
        SqlCommand command1 = new SqlCommand("INSERT INTO Table1 (Col1) VALUES('Value1')", connection, transaction);
        command1.ExecuteNonQuery();

        SqlCommand command2 = new SqlCommand("UPDATE Table2 SET Col2='NewValue'", connection, transaction);
        command2.ExecuteNonQuery();

        // If all steps are successful, commit the transaction
        transaction.Commit();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // If any step fails, roll back the entire transaction
        transaction.Rollback();
    }
}
```
<br>

## 8. Describe the _Connection Pooling_ in _ADO.NET_ and how it can be configured.

**ADO.NET's** connection pooling serves to optimize the performance of relational database access by  managing the reuse of open connections.

### Key Functions

- **Optimization**: Avoids the overhead of repetitively opening and closing database connections.
- **Resource Management**: Limits the number of concurrent database connections.

### Default Settings

- **Enabled**: Connection pooling is active by default in most ADO.NET providers.
- **Timeout**: The duration a connection can stay idle before being removed. Default: 2 minutes.
- **Maximum Connections**: The highest number of connections allowed per pool. Default: 100.

### Configurable Elements

- **Maximum Pool Size**: Limits the total number of connections in the pool. Exceeding this number will lead to queueing or connection refusal.
- **Minimum Pool Size**: Establishes an initial number of connections to create on pool creation.
- **Pooling**: Specifies if the provider uses connection pooling.

### Default vs Configured Connection Strings

#### Default Connection String
```sql
Data Source=myServer;Initial Catalog=myDB;User Id=myUser;Password=myPass;
```

#### Configured for Pooling
```csharp
"Data Source=myServer;Initial Catalog=myDB;User Id=myUser;Password=myPass;Pooling=true;Min Pool Size=5;Max Pool Size=100;"
```

### Code Example: Manually Configured Connection

Here is the C# Code:

```csharp
using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["MyConnection"].ConnectionString))
{
    connection.Open();

    // Execute SQL commands here
    
}
```
<br>

## 9. What is the purpose of _Command_ objects in _ADO.NET_?

The **Command** object in ADO.NET plays a crucial role in executing parameterized **SQL** statements. It functions as an interface between your application and the database and is a part of the **Data Access Layer**.

### Key Components of the Command Object

- **CommandText**: The SQL command to be run, which can be stored procedure, query, or table name for update operations.
- **Connection**: The database connection the command operates on.
- **CommandType**: Specifies command type as StoredProcedure, TableDirect, or Text (for SQL statements).

### Code Example: Using the Command Object

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

// Within a method or class:
var conStr = "your_connection_string";
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(conStr))
{
    connection.Open();
    using (var command = connection.CreateCommand())
    {
        command.CommandText = "SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Grade > @Grade";
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Grade", 7);
        command.CommandType = CommandType.Text;

        using (var reader = command.ExecuteReader())
        {
            // Process the data
        }
    }
}
```

### Benefits of Using Command Objects

- **Efficiency**: Command objects often lead to better performance as they can be "prepared" prior to execution, especially when dealing with repetitive queries.
- **Parameterization for Security**: Using parameters protects against SQL injection attacks.
- **Code Modularity and Reusability**: SQL and connection details are encapsulated, promoting separation of concerns.

### Common Command Object Misuses

- **Concatenating SQL Strings and Values** Increases the risks of SQL injection attacks.
- **Hard-Coding Credentials**: This is poor practice from a security standpoint. Instead, utilize config files or environment variables.
<br>

## 10. Can you explain what a _DataAdapter_ does in _ADO.NET_?

Let's look at the foundation of **`DataAdapter`** and the tasks it performs.

### Core Functions of DataAdapter

1. **Data Retrieval**: Focused on efficiently populating a `DataTable` or `DataSet` with data from a data source.
  
2. **Data Merging**: Responsible for merging updated data from the client application back into the original data source.
  
3. **Command Execution**: Serving as a bridge between the client application and the database, it executes commands such as `Select`, `Insert`, `Update`, and `Delete`.

### Key Components

- **`SelectCommand`**: This `Command` is specifically designed to retrieve data from the provider. It is commonly used for executing `SELECT` SQL statements and populating a `DataTable` or a `DataSet`.

- **`InsertCommand`**: When a new row of data is added to a `DataTable` in the client application, this `Command` is responsible for inserting it into the data source.

- **`UpdateCommand`**: After modifying an existing row in the `DataTable`, the `UpdateCommand` ensures that the original data in the source table is updated with the changes.

- **`DeleteCommand`**: This specialized `Command` is used to delete rows from the data source that have been removed from the client application's `DataTable`.
<br>

## 11. What is a _DataRelation_ object in a _DataSet_?

A **DataRelation** object in ADO.NET is a powerful construct that links two tables (**DataTable**s) within a single **DataSet** based on a common column or set of columns. This relationship enables a whole range of operations, including data browsing, data filtering, and ensuring data integrity constraints, such as enforcing parent-child dependencies and referential integrity.

### Core Components

1. **ParentTable** and **ChildTable**: Specifies the tables that are part of the relationship.
2. **ParentColumns** and **ChildColumns**: Identifies the columns that act as keys in their respective tables. These key columns establish the relationship between the `ParentTable` and the `ChildTable`.

Data in the `ChildTable` is related to data in the `ParentTable` through corresponding values in the designated key columns. In the example above, the relationship ties the `CustomerID` in the `Orders` table to the `CustomerID` in the `Customers` table.

### Main Features

- **Integrity Management**: Enforce referential integrity between parent and child rows. For instance, if a parent row is deleted or modified in a way that would result in orphaned child rows, the `DataRelation` can be set up to either restrict these actions or cascade changes to the child rows.

- **Navigation**: Establish a logical hierarchy between tables, making it easier to navigate and explore related data.

- **Filtering**: Conduct out-of-the-box filtering of child rows based on parent row values.

### Code Example: Defining and Accessing a DataRelation

Here is the C\# code:

```csharp
// Creating and populating DataTables
DataTable customersTable = new DataTable("Customers");
customersTable.Columns.Add("CustomerID", typeof(int));
customersTable.Columns.Add("Name", typeof(string));

DataTable ordersTable = new DataTable("Orders");
ordersTable.Columns.Add("OrderID", typeof(int));
ordersTable.Columns.Add("CustomerID", typeof(int));
ordersTable.Columns.Add("TotalAmount", typeof(decimal));

customersTable.Rows.Add(1, "John Doe");
customersTable.Rows.Add(2, "Jane Smith");

ordersTable.Rows.Add(1, 1, 100.0);
ordersTable.Rows.Add(2, 1, 200.0);
ordersTable.Rows.Add(3, 2, 150.0);

// Creating a DataSet and including the DataTables
DataSet dataSet = new DataSet();
dataSet.Tables.Add(customersTable);
dataSet.Tables.Add(ordersTable);

// Defining the DataRelation
DataRelation dataRelation = new DataRelation("CustomerOrders",
    customersTable.Columns["CustomerID"],
    ordersTable.Columns["CustomerID"]);

// Adding the DataRelation to the DataSet
dataSet.Relations.Add(dataRelation);
```
<br>

## 12. How do you filter and sort data in a _DataSet_?

In **ADO.NET** `DataSet`, **rows** within **tables** can be filtered and sorted using the `Select` method. For advanced operations, LINQ can be a powerful tool, especially when data needs to be filtered across multiple related tables.

### Basic Filtering with `DataTable.Select`

```csharp
DataRow[] filteredRows = dataSet.Tables["MyTable"].Select("ColumnName = 'DesiredValue'");
```

### Advanced Filtering with LINQ

Here is a C# code example:

```csharp
var filteredRows = from myRow in myTable.AsEnumerable()
                   where (string)myRow["ColumnName"] != "DesiredValue"
                   select myRow;
```

### Sorting

You can sort a **DataRow** array by calling `OrderBy` on the enumerable collection. Here is the C# code:

```csharp
var sortedRows = filteredRows.OrderBy(row => row["ColumnToSort"]);
```
<br>

## 13. What is a _DataProvider_ and how do you choose one?

In **ADO.NET**, a **DataProvider** serves as a bridge between an application and data source, allowing them to interact. Different types of DataProviders exist to cater to various data storage methods, such as SQL Server and Oracle.

### DataProvider Types

- **.NET Framework Data Providers**: These include classes in the `System.Data` namespace, facilitating data access for SQL Server, OLEDB, ODBC, and more.

- **ODBC Data Providers**: ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) Data Providers use generic drivers to access data across varied databases.

- **OLEDB Data Providers**: These are used with databases that provide OLEDB (Object Linking and Embedding Database) interfaces, like Microsoft Access and SQL Server.

- **Managed Providers**: Managed Providers are specific to .NET and are known for high performance and optimized data access.

- **Data Entity Framework (EF) Providers**: Often used with Visual Studio, these providers focus on data models in terms of entities and relationships rather than traditional databases.

### Factors to Consider in Choosing a Data Provider

1. **Compatibility with Data Source**: Ensure the provider is compatible with your data source (e.g., Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL).

2. **Performance Requirements**: Some providers may offer better performance for specific tasks or data sources. For example, a managed provider might offer better performance for SQL Server than OLEDB or ODBC.

3. **Connection Method**: Evaluate whether the data provider allows for more efficient connection methods, for example, direct TCP/IP connection versus using an intermediary like the ODBC Data Source Name (DSN).

4. **Security Features**: Consider the built-in security features of the provider, such as support for connection encryption and secure data transmission.

5. **Maintenance, Stability, and Documentation**: A well-maintained provider with good documentation can save time during development and troubleshooting.

6. **Application Requirements**: Evaluate specific needs such as scalability, portability, and flexibility, which can impact the choice of provider.

7. **Development Experience and Existing Skills**: Consider team expertise and familiarity with different data providers.

### Code Example: Using SQL Server Data Provider

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
using System.Data.SqlClient;
using System.Configuration;

// Connection string configuration in App.config
var connectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["MyDbConn"].ConnectionString;

// Establish the connection
using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    try
    {
        connection.Open();
        Console.WriteLine("Connection established!");

        // Execute other data operations, like queries and commands
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
    }
}
```
<br>

## 14. Can you define what a _Parameterized Query_ is in _ADO.NET_?

A **parameterized query** in ADO.NET uses placeholders for dynamic, user-supplied values. This design minimizes the **risk of SQL injection** and streamlines performance.

### Key Benefits

- **Security**: Parameters reduce the risk of SQL injection by handling input data securely. They distinguish between data and code, so input strings are treated only as literal values.

- **Performance**: Parameterized queries can be faster to execute, particularly when reused multiple times. They allow database engines to cache execution plans, optimizing query runtime.

- **Clarity**: By separating SQL logic from parameter definitions, parameterized queries are often more readable, simplifying maintenance and debugging.

### Core Elements

A parameterized query typically contains three fundamental components during its construction:

1. **SQL Command**: The basic query statement that defines the tasks to be performed.

2. **Parameters**: Named or unnamed placeholders within the SQL command. These are used to pass in external values safely.

3. **Parameter Values**: The actual, dynamically-provided values that will replace the placeholders when the query is executed.

### Code Example: Parameterized Query

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
// Assume 'connection' is an open SqlConnection object
var query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE UserName = @user AND Password = @password";
using (var command = new SqlCommand(query, connection))
{
    // Define query parameters
    command.Parameters.AddWithValue("user", userInput.UserName);
    command.Parameters.AddWithValue("password", userInput.Password);

    // Execute the query
    using (var reader = command.ExecuteReader())
    {
        // Fetch and process the data
    }
}
```
<br>

## 15. Explain how to implement _optimistic concurrency_ in _ADO.NET_.

**Optimistic Concurrency** in ADO.NET enables multi-user data management without requiring locks. It relies on data comparison to detect changes and handle potential conflicts, such as simultaneous updates.

**Primary Components**:

1. **Data Adapter**: Configures the UpdateCommand to include the original version of data. Upon updates, the adapter verifies that the current data matches the original version, or it aborts the update.

2. **Row Versioning or Timestamps**: A special column, often `ROWVERSION` in SQL Server, keeps track of data versions. This column should be included in all `SELECT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` SQL commands related to the dataset.

3. **Conflict Resolution Logic**: You, as the application developer, need to implement the logic to address conflicts that may arise during the update process.

### Code Example: Data Adapter Config for Optimistic Concurrency

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
// Assuming 'connection' is an open SqlConnection
var adapter = new SqlDataAdapter("SELECT * FROM your_table", connection);
var commandBuilder = new SqlCommandBuilder(adapter);

// Set the custom UpdateCommand
adapter.UpdateCommand = new SqlCommand(
    "UPDATE your_table SET col1=@val1, col2=@val2 WHERE id=@originalId AND rowversion = @originalRowVersion", 
    connection
);
adapter.UpdateCommand.Parameters.Add("@originalId", SqlDbType.Int, 0, "Id");
adapter.UpdateCommand.Parameters.Add("@originalRowVersion", SqlDbType.Timestamp, 0, "Timestamp").SourceVersion = DataRowVersion.Original;
adapter.UpdateCommand.Parameters.Add("@val1", SqlDbType.VarChar, 50, "Column1");
adapter.UpdateCommand.Parameters.Add("@val2", SqlDbType.VarChar, 50, "Column2");

adapter.Update(dt);  // dt is the DataTable with changes
```

In this code, `Timestamp` is used as `ROWVERSION` column type, and `@originalRowVersion` is set to `DataRowVersion.Original` to pass the original row version from the DataTable.

### Conflict Resolution Strategies

Common techniques for handling **concurrency conflicts** in an optimistic model include:

1. **Last in Wins (LIW)**: Unconditionally take the most recent change. This can lead to data loss and is a less preferred approach.

2. **Merge**: Combine the conflicting changes into a single coherent record. This approach is common in document-oriented databases where data can be merged based on a set of rules.

3. **User Notification**: Notify the user or client of the conflict and request guidance on how to resolve it. Generally, asking users to review and manually resolve conflicts should be a last resort due to its potential for error and inconvenience.

4. **Timestamp Adjustments**: If the conflict is due to data not being loaded at the same time, the application can double-check the timestamp before making an update. If the timestamp has changed, the application can take appropriate action, such as not saving the data or merging it. This approach is common when dealing with web-based interactions that can lead to out-of-date data being presented.
