## 1. What is _anomaly detection_?

**Anomaly Detection**, also known as **Outlier Detection**, is a machine learning method dedicated to identifying patterns in data that don't conform to the expected behavior, indicating potential risk, unusual activity, or errors.

### Applications

- **Fraud Detection**: Finding irregular financial transactions.
- **Network Security**: Identifying unusual network behavior indicating a potential threat.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Flagging equipment malfunctions.
- **Healthcare**: Detecting abnormal test results or physiological signs.

### Techniques

- **Domain-Specific Rules**: Directly apply predetermined guidelines sensitive to the specifics of a particular field. For instance, detecting temperature anomalies in a chemical plant.
- **Supervised Learning**: Utilize labeled data to train a model to recognize both normal and abnormal behavior.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Employ algorithms such as $k$-means clustering or Isolation Forest, which discern anomalies based on "unusualness" rather than specific labels.
- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: Hybrid approach that combines labeled and unlabeled examples, efficient when labeled data are scarce.

### Evaluation Techniques

- **Confusion Matrix**: Compares predictions to actual data, highlighting true and false positives and negatives.
- **Accuracy**: Measures overall model performance as a ratio of correctly identified entities to the total.
- **Precision**: Gauges the proportion of true positives among all entities that the model predicted as positive.
- **Recall**: Measures the ratio of true positives captured by the model among all actual positives in the dataset.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, offering a balanced assessment of the model's performance.
- **Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC-AUC)**: Plots the trade-off between true positives and false positives, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.

### Challenges

- **Imbalanced Data**: In scenarios where the majority of data is "normal," learning algorithms might struggle to identify the minority class.
- **Interpretability**: While some techniques provide clear-cut outputs, others, like neural networks, can be opaque, making it difficult to understand their decision-making process.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Many applications require instantaneous anomaly identification and response, posing challenges for algorithms and infrastructure.

### Best Practices

- **Feature Engineering**: Select and transform features to boost the accuracy of anomaly detection algorithms.
- **Metrics Selection**: Carefully select the evaluation metrics most reflective of the problem at hand.
- **Model Selection**: Determine the appropriate algorithm by considering the inherent properties of the data.
<br>

## 2. What are the main _types of anomalies_ in data?

**Anomalies**, or outliers, are unexpected points in data that differ significantly from the majority of the data points.

The three primary types of anomalies are:

### Contextual Anomalies

- **Description**: These anomalies are identified in a specific context or subset of the data and are not considered anomalies in other contexts.

- **Example**: Atypically high CPU usage during a specific time of the day (such as a scheduled backup task).

- **Practical Application**: Network traffic where unusual patterns might be normal during off-hours.

### Collective Anomalies

- **Description**: These anomalies are identified by a collective of data instances deviating from expected behavior, rather than individual data points.

- **Example**: A sudden spike in online sales during a flash discount event on e-commerce websites.

- **Practical Application**: Detecting coordinated cyber-attacks can be accomplished by identifying sudden spikes in the number of requests to a server, spanning multiple IP addresses.

### Point Anomalies

- **Description**: These anomalies are individual data points that are significantly different from the rest of the dataset.

- **Example**: A credit card transaction that is out of character for a specific cardholder's spending habits.

- **Practical Application**: Data monitoring such as in sensor networks or financial institutions for activities that stand out from the norm - such as detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.

### Outlier Visualizations

Visual representations are pivotal in understanding how anomalies appear.

- **Contextual**: Visualize contextual features or domains where anomalies are evident.
- **Collective**: Data dimensions might be grouped or aggregated to reveal collective anomalies.
- **Point**: The focus is on individuals that stand out in multi-dimensional space.
<br>

## 3. How does _anomaly detection_ differ from _noise removal_?

While both **anomaly detection** and **noise removal** aim to identify and filter out irregularities, their objectives and methodologies are distinct.

### Core Distinctions

   - **Objective**
     - Anomaly Detection:  Identifies data points that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset.
     - Noise Removal:  Aims to remove random or uninformative data points, often attributed to measurement errors or other sources.

   - **Methodology**
     - Anomaly Detection:  Leverages statistical, distance-based, or machine learning methods.
     - Noise Removal: Often employs filtering techniques such as moving averages or median smoothing.
  
  - **Data Integrity**
     - Anomaly Detection:  Identifies unique and potentially valuable data points, especially in **complex systems** where noise and anomalies coexist.
      - Noise Removal: Seeks to enhance data quality by eliminating unwanted noise, potentially at the expense of discarding valid but irregular data points.

- **Application Context**
  - Anomaly Detection: Critical in financial fraud detection, network security, equipment monitoring, and more.
  
  - Noise Removal: Vital in preprocessing raw data from sensors, unstructured text, or images to enhance signal quality before further analysis.
<br>

## 4. Explain the concepts of _outliers_ and their impact on _dataset_.

**Outliers** are data points that stray significantly from the overall pattern in a dataset, potentially due to errors, natural variation, or meaningful but rare occurrences.

They can profoundly influence data analysis and machine learning models, leading to skewed results and inaccurate predictions.

### Impact on Models

- **Parametric Models**: Outliers can distort the estimation of model parameters, leading to unreliable results. For instance, in a linear regression model, an outlier can heavily influence the slope and intercept of the line of best fit.

- **Non-Parametric Models**: These can be sensitive to outliers as well, while some are designed to be robust.

### Consequences on Analysis

#### Mean, Variance, Correlation

- **Arithmetic mean**: Highly susceptible to outliers, often no longer representing the central tendency of the dataset.
- **Standard deviation**: Outliers inflate the standard deviation, skewing calculations relating to data dispersion.
- **Correlation**: Outliers can potentially affect correlation coefficients, leading to misinterpretations of relationships.

#### Hypothesis Testing

- When datasets have outliers, they can influence statistical tests and lead to false conclusions, particularly for tests like t-tests and ANOVA.

#### Clustering and Accuracy

- **Clustering Algorithms**: The presence of outliers can influence cluster centers and inaccurately classify the data points, especially in K-means clustering.
- **Classification Models**: Outliers can skew decision boundaries, leading to misclassifications in models like SVMs.

#### Recommendation Systems

- In recommendation systems, outliers can unduly influence collaborative filtering algorithms, leading to less accurate recommendations.

#### Tree-based Models

- While decision trees can handle outliers, their presence can affect decision boundaries and, in ensemble methods like random forests, influence feature importance.

### Data Preprocessing

Before fitting a model or conducting any analysis, it's generally advised to **normalize** or **scale data** to mitigate the influence of outliers.

#### Techniques to Address Outliers

- **Truncation**: Setting extreme values to fixed thresholds.
- **Winsorization**: Replacing extreme values with adjacent, less extreme ones.
- **Clipping**: Capping extreme values at a certain percentile.
- **Transformation**: Such as the log transformation, making data less sensitive to outliers.

### Visual Detection

Outliers often stand out on visualizations:

- **Box Plots**: Data points outside the whiskers are likely outliers.
- **Histograms**: Visual cues such as isolated bars.
<br>

## 5. What is the difference between _supervised_ and _unsupervised_ anomaly detection?

**Anomaly detection** methods can be categorized into **supervised** and **unsupervised learning** techniques, each with its distinctive approach in dealing with labeled data.

### Supervised Anomaly Detection

In **supervised** anomaly detection, algorithms are trained on labeled data that contains examples of both normal and anomalous behavior. This method is effective when reliable labeled data is available.

- **Data Requirement**: Supervised methods need labeled instances of both normal and anomalous data to be effective.
  
- **Training Strategy**: The model is trained on features extracted from both normal and anomalous data to learn their characteristic patterns. 

- **Model Types**: Popular algorithms for supervised anomaly detection include Decision Trees (DT), Random Forests (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### Unsupervised Anomaly Detection

In **unsupervised** anomaly detection, the algorithms operate on data without explicit labels, seeking to identify instances that are substantially different from the majority of the data. This makes unsupervised methods especially useful when labeled datasets are limited or not available.

- **Data Requirement**: Unsupervised methods can work with unlabeled data, making them suitable for datasets where obtaining labeled anomalies is difficult or costly.

- **Outlier Detection**: The primary task of these methods is to detect outliers, or anomalies, from the majority of the data.

- **Model Types**: Common unsupervised approaches include Density-based techniques like Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Distance-based methods such as k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Probabilistic and Clustering approaches. 

- **Trend Toward Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**: Recent advancements in Deep Learning and other techniques have opened new avenues of using semi-supervised and unsupervised learning in various anomaly detection tasks, providing more flexibility and adaptability, especially in scenarios where large labeled datasets are not readily available.

### Hybrid Methods: Best of Both Worlds

Hybrid methods and techniques can harness the strengths of both supervised and unsupervised methods, potentially improving the accuracy and efficiency of anomaly detection systems. Common hybrid approaches include:

- **Semi-Supervised Learning**: This middle ground uses both labeled and unlabeled data for training. A modest amount of labeled data can help direct the model towards more accurate anomaly detection. Examples include One-Class SVM and autoencoders.

- **Active Learning**: Initiates model training with a small set of labeled data, and then iteratively selects the most useful data points for labeling to improve the model's performance.

- **Transfer Learning**: Involves using knowledge or trained models from one task or domain and applying it to another, potentially disjoint, task or domain.
<br>

## 6. What are some _real-world applications_ of _anomaly detection_?

**Anomaly detection** has a variety of applications across industries, playing a crucial role in maintaining **security**, **fault detection**, **quality control**, and more. Let's look at applications in several key domains.

### Finance

- **Credit Card Fraud Detection**: Identifies unusual, potentially fraudulent transactions.
- **Algorithmic Trading**: Flags abnormally performing trades or market conditions.

### IT and Security

- **Intrusion Detection**: Recognizes potentially unauthorized access or malicious activities in a network.
- **System Health Monitoring**: Pinpoints potential hardware or software issues by detecting deviations in system metrics.

### Healthcare

- **Medical Fraud Detection**: Helps identify fraudulent insurance claims in healthcare.
- **Patient Monitoring**: Alerts healthcare professionals to deviations in patient vital signs or behavior.

### Marketing 

- **Ad Fraud Detection**: Identifies and omits bot-generated ad interactions.
- **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Pinpoints unusual actions that could indicate fraud or non-genuine activity.

### Industrial Applications

- **Manufacturing Quality Control**: Detects defective products on production lines.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Helps in identifying equipment that is likely to fail or needs immediate attention to avoid unplanned downtime.

### Telecommunications

- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Detects unusual spikes or drops in data, which may indicate technical issues or possible attacks.

### Geography and Environmental Monitoring

- **Geospatial Monitoring**: Identifies irregularities in satellite imagery or geographical data. Can be used for detecting illegal mining, deforestation, or urban sprawl.

### Transport

- **Anomaly-driven Highway Maintenance**: Detects irregularities like potholes and reports these for repair.

### Text and Speech Processing

- **Plagiarism Detection**: Identifies passages of text that are likely copied.
- **Spam Filtering**: Recognizes atypical patterns or contents in emails or messages.
<br>

## 7. What is the _role of statistics_ in _anomaly detection_?

**Anomaly detection** techniques often leverage statistical methods to **quantify the divergence** of a data point or behavior from the expected norm. The role of **statistics** is paramount in modeling the "normal" behavior of a system and gauging the **novelty** of observed instances.

### Statistical Methods in Anomaly Detection

- **Quantifying Normality**: Statistical models establish a range within which "normal" observations are expected. Data points falling outside this range are deemed anomalous.

- **Inference of Aberrations**: By computing statistical scores, systems assign anomaly likelihoods to data points. These could be based on distance measures, such as Mahalanobis or z-scores, or probability density functions.

- **Data Representation and Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and other statistical methods are used to reduce high-dimensionality data to a more manageable, interpretable form.

- **Temporal Analysis**: Time-series data often require sophisticated methods like autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), to model trends, periodicity, or seasonality.

- **Combining Information Sources**: Methods like Bayesian inference fuse prior knowledge with new data to refine anomaly predictions.

- **Risk Assessment**: Outliers are evaluated in the context of their potential impact on the system. Statistical models help assess risk associated with anomalies.

- **Interactive Learning**: Models are updated based on user feedback. Statistics guide model updates to ensure continuous improvement.

### Code Example: Univariate Anomaly Detection with z-Scores

Here is the Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate sample data
np.random.seed(42)
data = np.random.normal(loc=10, scale=2, size=100)

# Compute z-scores
mean = np.mean(data)
std_dev = np.std(data)
z_scores = (data - mean) / std_dev

# Set z-score threshold for anomalies
z_score_threshold = 2.5
anomalies = np.abs(z_scores) > z_score_threshold
print("Anomalous data points:", data[anomalies])
```
<br>

## 8. How do you handle _high-dimensional data_ in _anomaly detection_?

**High-dimensional data** presents unique challenges in anomaly detection, often necessitating advanced strategies for accurate model performance.

### Challenges of High-Dimensional Data

- **Increased Sensitivity**: Statistical methods, especially those reliant on distance metrics like $k$-Nearest Neighbors become less reliable with higher dimensions. This is caused by the "curse of dimensionality," where distances between points tend to converge.
  
- **Diminishing Discriminative Power**: As the number of features rises, traditional techniques such as scatter plots or visualizations become less effective for discerning anomalies.

- **Sample Density**: With limited data points in high-dimensional spaces, it becomes harder to define "typical" density regions, making outlier identification more challenging.


### Coping Strategies

####  Feature Selection and Extraction

- **Dimension Reduction**: Techniques like PCA and t-SNE can transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space while retaining essential patterns. However, it's important to consider interpretability.

- **Feature Selection**: Identify and keep only the most influential features to lower dimensionality. Techniques like mutual information or LASSO can assist in this process.

#### Anomaly Detection Algorithms

- **Model Selection**: Utilize methods designed for high-dimensional data, such as Local Outlier Factor (LOF), which evaluates the local density of data points.

- **Simplicity vs. Complexity**: Balance the need for algorithm sophistication with interpretability.

- **Ensemble Learning**: Combine outputs from multiple models to enhance overall predictive accuracy.

#### Data Preprocessing

- **Normalization**: Scaling features to a consistent range can improve the accuracy of distance-based methods.

- **Outlier Removal**: Consider eliminating obvious outliers from the dataset before applying more sophisticated models.

#### Model Evaluation

- **Cross-Validation**: Attributing IntricaciesWith a high-dimensional dataset, traditional cross-validation techniques might yield misleading results due to sparsity. Stratified or leave-one-out approaches may be more suitable.

#### Visual and Interactive Tools

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic visual tools or dashboards let users adjust parameters or explore the data, aiding in anomaly discovery.

- **Focus on Subsets**: Visualize specific feature combinations or clusters of interest instead of the full feature space.

### Code Example: Feature Selection and PCA for Dimensionality Reduction

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, mutual_info_classif
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Assuming `X` is your feature matrix and `y` is the target vector
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Univariate feature selection using mutual information
k_best_features = SelectKBest(mutual_info_classif, k=10).fit_transform(X_scaled, y)

# PCA for dimensionality reduction
pca = PCA(n_components=10)  # Choose the number of principal components based on explained variance or other criteria
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
```
<br>

## 9. What are some _common statistical methods_ for _anomaly detection_?

**Statistical techniques** form a fundamental approach to detecting anomalies in data. They focus on identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm.

### Common Statistical Techniques for Anomaly Detection

1. **Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)**:
   - Utilize techniques such as "68-95-99.7" rule to identify outliers in Gaussian data.
   - Apply methods like Z-Score and Q-Q plot to assess normality and identify outliers.

2. **Multivariate Statistics**:
   - Handle multiple variables simultaneously to identify anomalies that are not obvious in univariate analysis.
   - Techniques like Mahalanobis distance and PCA can be adapted for anomaly detection.

3. **Smoothing Techniques**:
   - Methods like moving averages and exponential smoothing provide a way to visualize and identify fluctuations in time series data.

4. **Central Tendency Measures**:
   - Use measures such as mean, median and mode as the center of the data, and identify extreme-valued points (outliers).


### Code Example: Z-Score for Anomaly Detection

Here is the Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Generate normal and outlier data
data = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1000)
data[0] = 1000  # Introduce outlier

# Calculate z-scores
z_scores = (data - np.mean(data)) / np.std(data)

# Set a z-score threshold (e.g., 3 standard deviations)
z_threshold = 3

# Identify outliers
outliers = np.abs(z_scores) > z_threshold

print("Detected outliers:", data[outliers])
```
<br>

## 10. Explain the working principle of _k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors)_ in _anomaly detection_.

**k-Nearest Neighbors** (**k-NN**) is a **non-parametric** machine learning algorithm used in various domains, including **anomaly detection**.

### Anomaly Detection with k-NN

In a k-NN-based **anomaly detection** setup, each test point is assigned a label (anomaly or not) based on its **local density** compared to its $k$ nearest neighbors. The density-based score can be measured as the **distance to the k-th nearest neighbor** for the test point:

```
Score(test point) = nearest\_dist\_k(test point)
```


Test points with high scores, i.e., large distances to their k-th nearest neighbors, are considered anomalies.

Consider the traffic data in the image given below. Each data point represents an event on a network, and the examples are color-coded to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. The circled data points are classified as anomalies.

The main steps involved are:

1. **Training**: This is essentially storing the data.
2. **Testing**:
   - **Point Query**: Assess a specific test data point.
   - **Score Assignment**: Calculate the $k$ nearest neighbors and their distances to assign a score.
3. **Decision Making**: Classify as anomaly or normal based on the assigned score and a predefined cutoff (or adjusted threshold).

Let's look at the Python code:

### k-NN for Anomaly Detection: Python code

```python
from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors
import numpy as np

# Generating sample data
np.random.seed(42)
normal_points = np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=1, size=(100, 2))
anomalous_points = np.random.normal(loc=3, scale=1, size=(10, 2))
all_data = np.vstack([normal_points, anomalous_points])

# Training the k-NN model (k=5)
knn_model = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=5).fit(all_data)

# Calculating scores for the test points
test_point = np.array([[2, 2]])  # Assuming this is the test point
distances, indices = knn_model.kneighbors(test_point)
kth_nearest_distance = distances[0][-1]
anomaly_cutoff = 1.5  # A predefined threshold
score = kth_nearest_distance

# Decision making
if score > anomaly_cutoff:
    print("The test point is an anomaly.")
else:
    print("The test point is not an anomaly.")
```
<br>

## 11. Describe how _cluster analysis_ can be used for detecting _anomalies_.

**Cluster Analysis** can be a powerful tool for **anomaly detection**, particularly in unsupervised learning scenarios.

### Unsupervised Learning & Anomaly Detection

In unsupervised learning, the focus is on patterns and relationships within data, rather than on specific target outcomes. **Anomaly detection** in this context aims to identify data points that are statistically different from the majority, without the need for labeled examples.

### K-Means as a Clustering Approach

- **K-Means** is a widely used clustering algorithm that partitions data into **K** clusters based on distances from cluster centers. Data points are assigned to the nearest cluster center, and the centers are updated iteratively.

- K-Means identifies **"normal" data regions** by grouping similar data points together.

### Detecting Anomalies with K-Means

- After K-Means clustering, anomalies can be recognized as data points that are:

  1. Farthest from their cluster centroid, maybe exceeding a certain number of standard deviations.
  2. Not assigned to any cluster, which occurs when they are relatively isolated from the rest of the data.

- The second kind of anomaly only applies in non-extreme situations when data doesn't adhere well to the k-means cluster shape.

### Code Example: Anomaly Detection with K-Means

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Generating random data
np.random.seed(42)
X, _ = make_blobs(n_samples=300, cluster_std=1.5, centers=3)

# Initializing and fitting KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
kmeans.fit(X)

# Calculating distances to cluster centers
distances = kmeans.transform(X)

# Identifying anomalies
anomalies = np.where(np.max(distances, axis=1) > thresholds)

# Visualizing the results
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(X[anomalies, 0], X[anomalies, 1], c='r', marker='x', label='Anomalies')
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], c='black', marker='o', label='Cluster Centers')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
<br>

## 12. Explain how the _Isolation Forest algorithm_ works.

The **Isolation Forest** (iForest) algorithm is an efficient and accurate method for detecting anomalies in large datasets. It is based on the principles of decision trees, utilizing their natural ability to distinguish outliers in a dataset.

### Key Concepts

- **Isolation**: The method identifies anomalies by isolating them. Anomalies are expected to have a different path length within trees compared to normal instances.

- **Randomness**: The algorithm introduces randomness to create a set of diverse and uncorrelated trees for better accuracy.

- **Path Length**: The average depth of anomalies within the trees is shorter, which is used as a measure of their outlierness.

### How It Works

1. **Initialization**: Select a subset of the dataset, and set an initial tree height limit.

2. **Tree Growth**: Grow multiple trees with a stopping criterion. Unlike standard decision trees, the iForest does not split nodes based on information gain or Gini impurity.

3. **Isolation**: Anomalies are expected to have shorter average path lengths from the root of the tree.

4. **Anomaly Score**: The average path length of an instance $x$ across all trees is used as its anomaly score.

5. **Thresholding**: Define a cut-off value to distinguish between anomalies and normal instances.

### Code Example: Isolation Forest with scikit-learn

Here is the Python code:

  ```python
  from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
  import numpy as np

  # Generating random data - replace this with your dataset
  data = np.random.randn(100, 2)

  # Initializing the Isolation Forest
  model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)  # 10% expected contamination

  # Fitting the model
  model.fit(data)

  # Predicting anomalies
  predictions = model.predict(data)
  ```
<br>

## 13. Explain the concept of a _Z-Score_ and how it is used in _anomaly detection_.

**Z-score**, often used in **standard scoring**, is a statistical measure that quantifies how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. In anomaly detection, it is employed to identify observations that fall outside a defined threshold.

### Z-Score Formula

The formula to calculate the Z-score of a data point $X$ from a distribution with a known mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ is:

$$
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

Here, $X$ represents the data point, $\mu$ is the mean of the distribution and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation.

### Anomaly Detection with Z-Scores

1. **Data Collection**: Obtain a dataset relevant to the anomaly detection problem at hand.

2. **Feature Selection**: Choose the feature(s) to which you want to apply the anomaly detection method. For each feature, calculate its Z-score.

3. **Threshold Definition**: Establish one or more thresholds beyond which data points are deemed anomalous, usually in terms of Z-scores. Common thresholds include $Z = \pm2$ or $Z = \pm3$, indicating a data point that is 2 or 3 standard deviations away from the mean, respectively.

4. **Evaluation**: Compare the Z-scores of individual data points to the defined threshold(s). Any data point with a Z-score exceeding the threshold is considered an anomaly.

### Z-Score Limitations

- **Dependency on the Normality Assumption:** Z-score calculations are grounded in the assumption of normality, sometimes referred to as the bell curve. Data that does not follow this distribution might not yield accurate Z-scores.

- **Impact of Outliers**: If the data contains outliers, the Z-score can be heavily influenced, leading to misidentification of true anomalies.

- **The need for Known Mean and Standard Deviation**: Calculating Z-scores requires prior knowledge of a distribution's mean and standard deviation. In real-world scenarios, these parameters might not be available.

- **Potential Interpretation Issues**: Transactions and other data points might not be easily interpretable in terms of standard deviations from the mean.

### Code Example: Calculating Z-Score

Here is the Python code:

```python
import numpy as np

# Sample data
data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Calculate mean and standard deviation
mean, std_dev = np.mean(data), np.std(data)

# Calculate Z-scores
z_scores = (data - mean) / std_dev

print(z_scores)
```
<br>

## 14. Describe the _autoencoder approach_ for _anomaly detection_ in _neural networks_.

The **autoencoder** approach to **anomaly detection** utilizes an unsupervised neural network to pass data through a bottleneck layer, also known as the **latent space**, to then try to reconstruct the data.

If an input is accurately reconstructed, it is deemed **normal**. If it differs substantially from the original, it is labeled as an **anomaly**.

### Key Components of an Autoencoder

#### 1. Encoder

The encoder condenses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation.

#### 2. Decoder

The decoder attempts to reconstruct the original input from this lower-dimensional representation.

#### 3. Bottleneck Layer

This layer, typically containing fewer neurons than both the input and output layers, defines the **latent space**.

### Loss Function

The reconstruction error, calculated as the difference between the input and the decoder's output, serves as the autoencoder's loss function.

### Activation Function

The choice of activation functions in autoencoders depends on the nature of the input data. For binary data, the **sigmoid** function is suitable, while real-valued input can benefit from **tanh**.

### Probability Distribution

In applications where the input is governed by a particular probability distribution, such as Gaussian, models like the **Variational Autoencoder** (VAE) can ensure that the latent space conforms to this distribution.

### Code Example: Simple Autoencoder

Here is the Python code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Model Architecture
input_data = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(784,))
encoded = tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu')(input_data)
decoded = tf.keras.layers.Dense(784, activation='sigmoid')(encoded)
autoencoder = tf.keras.Model(input_data, decoded)

# Compile and Train
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
autoencoder.fit(x_train, x_train, epochs=5, batch_size=128, shuffle=True, validation_data=(x_val, x_val))
```

### Key Considerations

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize inputs to a certain range, such as [0, 1], to optimize training.
- **Neural Network Complexity**: A more complex model, including deeper and wider networks, may provide better reconstruction and, therefore, more accurate anomaly detection.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The autoencoder is trained without explicit anomaly labels, which can be beneficial when labeled data is scarce or non-existent.
<br>

## 15. How does _Principal Component Analysis (PCA)_ help in identifying anomalies?

**Principal Component Analysis** (PCA) is a mathematical technique that simplifies high-dimensional data into lower dimensions, making it suitable for **anomaly detection**.

### Key Concept: Maximizing Variance

PCA aims to find directions, called **principal components**, along which the data has the maximum variance. The first principal component ($PC_1$) accounts for the most variance, the second ($PC_2$) for the next most, and so on.

### Key Concept: Orthogonal Principal Components

These components are mutually orthogonal, meaning they are linearly independent and uncorrelated.

$$
\begin{bmatrix}PC_1\\PC_2\\\vdots\\PC_n\end{bmatrix} \perp \begin{bmatrix}PC_1\\PC_2\\\vdots\\PC_n\end{bmatrix} \quad \text{where } n \text{ is the number of variables}
$$

### Key Concept: Reconstructing Data

You can also reconstruct the original data from the principal components, keeping just a subset to reduce the data dimensionality.

### Anomaly Identification

PCA aids in detecting anomalies through two main methods:

- **Mahalanobis Distance**: This measures the distance of a data point from the centroid of the dataset and is used in various statistical analyses. Points that fall outside a certain threshold are flagged as anomalies.

- **Reconstruction Error**: Data points that cannot be accurately reconstructed from the principal components are considered anomalies.

### Code Example: Anomaly Detection with PCA and Mahalanobis Distance

Here is the Python code:

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from scipy.spatial.distance import mahalanobis

# Generate PCA and transform data
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
transformed_data = pca.fit_transform(data)

# Calculate centroid and covariance matrix
centroid = transformed_data.mean(axis=0)
covariance = np.cov(transformed_data.T)

# Calculate Mahalanobis distance for each point
distances = [mahalanobis(point, centroid, covariance) for point in transformed_data]

# Flag anomalies outside a threshold distance
threshold = np.mean(distances) + 2 * np.std(distances)
anomalies = [point for point, distance in zip(transformed_data, distances) if distance > threshold]
