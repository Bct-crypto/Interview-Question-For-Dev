## 🔹 1. What is _Bit_?

### Answer

The term **"bit"** stems from "binary" and "digit." As the basic unit of information in computing and digital communications, a bit can assume one of two values: 0 or 1.

### Binary System vs Decimal System

Computers operate using a **binary number system**, employing just two numerals: 0 and 1. In contrast, our day-to-day decimal system is **base-10**, utilizing ten numerals (0-9).

In the binary system:
- **Bit**: Represents 0 or 1
- **Nibble**: Comprises 4 bits, representing 16 values (0-15 in decimal)
- **Byte**: Contains 8 bits, representing 256 values (0-255 in decimal)

For instance, the decimal number 5 is depicted as $0101_2$ in binary.

### Bit Manipulation

Bits are pivotal in **bit manipulation**, a field encompassing operations like bit shifting, logical operations (AND, OR, XOR), and bit masking. These techniques find applications in data compression, encryption, and device control.

Considering two 8-bit numbers: $0010\,1010$ and $0000\,1100$. The logical AND operation gives:

$$
\begin{array}{c c c c c c c c c}
  & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
\text{AND} & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
  & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
\end{array}
$$

### Integer Representation in Bits

An integer's representation typically occupies a **fixed** number of bits. On many systems, an integer uses **32 bits**. Thus, a 32-bit signed integer spans $-2^{31}$ to $2^{31} - 1$.

### Hardware Considerations

Although **bits** underpin computing, hardware designs can constrain their usage. A 32-bit CPU processes 32 bits simultaneously, requiring extra steps for larger numbers. This led to the adoption of "**double words**" and "**quad words**" to represent larger integers.

## 🔹 2. What is a _Byte_?

### Answer

A **byte** is a foundational data unit in computing and telecommunications, capable of representing 256 unique values, ranging from 0 to 255. It consists of 8 **bits**, the smallest data storage units, which can be either 0 or 1.

### Bit Composition

Each bit in a byte has a place value, starting from the least significant bit (LSB) on the right to the most significant bit (MSB) on the left. Their place values are: 

| Place Value | Bit Position |
|-------------|--------------|
| 128         | 7            |
| 64          | 6            |
| 32          | 5            |
| 16          | 4            |
| 8           | 3            |
| 4           | 2            |
| 2           | 1            |
| 1           | 0            |


Setting all bits to 1 yields the byte's maximum value of 255.

### Converting Bytes to Decimal

To find the decimal equivalent of a byte, sum the place values of bits set to 1. For a byte with all bits as 1:

$$
1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255
$$

### Code Example: Byte to Decimal Conversion

Here is the Python code:

```python
def byte_to_decimal(byte_str):
    # Reverse the string for right-to-left calculation
    byte_str = byte_str[::-1]
    
    # Sum up place values for bits set to 1
    return sum(int(byte_str[i]) * 2 ** i for i in range(len(byte_str)))

# Example usage
byte_value = "11111111"  # All bits are 1
decimal_value = byte_to_decimal(byte_value)
print(decimal_value)  # Output: 255
```

## 🔹 3. Explain what is a _Bitwise Operation_.

### Answer

**Bitwise operations** are actions applied to individual bits within binary numbers or data units like integers. These operations offer several advantages, including speed and memory efficiency, and are widely used in specific computing scenarios.

### Why Use Bitwise Operations?

- **Speed**: Executing bitwise operations is often faster than using standard arithmetic or logical operations.
  
- **Memory Efficiency**: Operating at the bit level allows the storage of multiple flags or small integers within a single data unit, optimizing memory usage.

- **Low-Level Programming**: These operations are crucial in embedded systems and microcontroller programming.

- **Data Manipulation**: Bitwise operations can selectively alter or extract specific bits from a data unit.

### Types of Operators

#### Logical Operators

1. **AND (`&`)**: Yields `1` if corresponding bits are both `1`; otherwise, `0`.
   - Example: $5$ & $3 = 1$.
  
2. **OR (`|`)**: Yields `1` if one or both corresponding bits are `1`; otherwise, `0`.
    - Example: $5 | 3 = 7$.

3. **XOR (`^`)**: Yields `1` when corresponding bits differ; otherwise, `0`.
    - Example: $5 \oplus 3 = 6$.

4. **NOT (`~`)**: Inverts all bits.
    - Example: $~5$ becomes $-6$ in 2's complement.

#### Shift Operators

1. **Left Shift (`<<`)**: Moves bits to the left and fills in with `0`.
    - Example: $5 \text{ << 2 } = 20$.

2. **Right Shift (`>>`)**: Moves bits to the right and fills in based on the sign of the number.
    - Example: $5 \text{ >> 2 } = 1$.

3. **Zero Fill Right Shift (>>>)**: Shifts bits right, filling in zeros.
    - Example: $-5 \text{ >>> 2 } = 1073741823$.
    
#### Specialized Operations

- **Ones' Complement**: Similar to NOT but restricted to 32 bits.
    - Example: $(-5)$ & $0xFFFFFFFF$.

- **Twos' Complement**: Used for representing negative numbers in two's complement arithmetic.
    - Example: $~5 + 1 = -6$.

### Practical Applications

- **Flag Management**: Bits can represent on/off flags, and bitwise operators can be used to toggle these.

- **Data Compression**: These operations play a role in compression algorithms.
  
- **Encryption**: Bitwise manipulation is used in cryptographic algorithms.

### Code Example: Flag Manipulation

Here is the Python code:

```python
# Define flags with binary representation
FLAG_A, FLAG_B, FLAG_C, FLAG_D = 0b0001, 0b0010, 0b0100, 0b1000

# Set flags B and D
flags = FLAG_B | FLAG_D

# Check if Flag C is set
print("Flag C is set" if flags & FLAG_C else "Flag C is not set")
```
