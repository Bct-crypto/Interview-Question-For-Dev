## 1. What is _Dependency Injection_ and why is it used in modern software development?

**Dependency Injection (DI)** is a software design pattern that facilitates component collaboration by externalizing their dependencies. This technique brings several benefits.

### Benefits of Dependency Injection

- **Component Isolation**: Enhances the modularity, reusability, and testability of individual components.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for interchangeable components, promoting robustness and adaptability.
- **Seamless Testing**: Makes it simpler to test each component in isolation.

In practical terms, DI consists of three fundamental components:

1. **Service Provider**: Responsible for managing dependencies.
2. **Client Component**: Relies on services provided by the service provider.
3. **Service Interface**: Defines the contract between the service provider and the client component.

### Core Principles

- **Inversion of Control**: Modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, and these abstractions will be provided externally.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Ensures that each module is responsible for its specific task, and dependencies are managed externally.

### The 3 Variants of DI

1. **Constructor Injection**: Dependencies are provided through the constructor.
   
   **Code Example**
   ```java
   public class ClientComponent {
       private final IService service;
       public ClientComponent(IService service) {
           this.service = service;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Method (Setter) Injection**: Dependencies are set via a method, commonly known as a **setter method**.

   **Code Example**
   ```java
   public class ClientComponent {
       private IService service;
       public void setService(IService service) {
           this.service = service;
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Field Injection**: Dependencies are directly assigned to a field. This approach is often discouraged due to reduced encapsulation.

   **Code Example**
   ```java
   public class ClientComponent {
       @Inject
       private IService service;
   }
   ```
<br>

## 2. Explain the concept of _Inversion of Control (IoC)_ and how it relates to _Dependency Injection_.

**Inversion of Control (IoC)** and **Dependency Injection (DI)** are key concepts for creating modular, scalable, and testable software.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The Dependency Inversion Principle defines a relationship between high-level and low-level modules. It does this by introducing an abstraction that both high-level and low-level modules depend on.

### IoC and Abstraction

- **Traditional Control**: In class-based programming, when an object needs another object to perform a certain task, it directly creates or looks up the dependent object.
  
- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**: With IoC, the control over the instantiation or providing of the dependent object is moved outside the object. The base module provides an interface, making the low-level module dependent on the interface, rather than on a concrete implementation. A config file, a factory, or a separate module is often responsible for providing the concrete implementation, resulting in a more modular and flexible system.

### Key Players in IoC
1. **IOC Container**: A core mechanism that takes responsibility for instantiating, maintaining, and configuring objects in an application. It leverages DI to fulfill objects' required external dependencies.
  
2. **DI**: Responsible for 'injecting' these dependencies into an object when it's being created, ensuring it has everything it needs to function.

3. **Service Provider**: A module or class responsible for instantiating and managing application services or components.


### Implementing IoC Containers

Many modern frameworks, such as .NET with its `IServiceCollection` and `IServiceProvider`, provide built-in IoC capabilities to manage Spring Beans or Beans in Spring Framework.

Here's the .NET specific code:

```csharp
// ConfigureServices method in Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<IAuditService, DatabaseAuditService>();
    services.AddScoped<IUserService, UserService>();
    services.AddSingleton<IMailService, SmtpMailService>();
}
```
And, you use IoC in the rest of your application like this:

```csharp
public class UserController
{
    private readonly IUserService _userService;
    private readonly IAuditService _auditService;

    public UserController(IUserService userService, IAuditService auditService)
    {
        _userService = userService;
        _auditService = auditService;
    }

    public void CreateOrUpdateUser(User user)
    {
        _userService.CreateOrUpdate(user);
        _auditService.Log(user);
    }
}
```

### Advantages of IoC and Dependency Injection

- **Modularity**: Individual components become independent modules, minimizing their interdependencies.
  
- **Flexibility**: Replacement of dependencies is made simple, resulting in more flexible and adaptable systems.
  
- **Unit Testing**: It becomes easier to test modules in isolation as you can mock or provide fake dependencies to see how they behave.
<br>

## 3. What are the main advantages of using _Dependency Injection_ in a software project?

**Dependency Injection** (DI) offers a range of benefits that simplify software development and make code more modular, scalable, and flexible.

### Advantages

- **Promotes Modular Code**: DI helps in creating smaller, single-responsibility classes, which ties back to the principles of **SOLID** design.

- **Easier Testing**: By separating concerns, it's simpler to bimplement and carry out unit tests, leading to more robust and reliable software.

- **Favors Interface Usage**: Favoring interfaces over concrete implementations encourages code that's more adaptable and can handle future changes more effectively.

- **Clearer Code Intent**: By explicitly stating the dependencies a class relies on, it becomes clearer what that class does and how it uses other components.

- **Simplified Object Lifecycle Management**: This advantage is more pronounced in the context of **IoC** containers, where the container takes charge of the objects' lifecycles.

- **Promotes Decoupling**: DI reduces the level of interdependence between software components, resulting in a system that's more flexible and easier to maintain.

### Code Example: Without DI

Here is the Java code:

```java
public class Laptop {
    private HardDisk hardDisk;
    private CPU cpu;

    public Laptop(){
        this.hardDisk = new HardDisk();
        this.cpu = new CPU();
    }

    public void bootUp() {
        hardDisk.spin();
        cpu.process();
    }
}
```

In this code, both the `Laptop` class and the `HardDisk` and `CPU` classes are tightly-coupled. You cannot easily swap out `HardDisk` for a different component, it doesn't adhere to the single responsibility principle or to the "code to an interface" principle.

### Code Example: With DI

Here is the Java code:

```java
public class Laptop {
    private StorageDevice storageDevice;
    private Processor processor;

    // Constructor injection
    public Laptop(StorageDevice storageDevice, Processor processor) {
        this.storageDevice = storageDevice;
        this.processor = processor;
    }

    public void bootUp() {
        storageDevice.spin();
        processor.process();
    }
}
```

In this version, the `Laptop` class doesn't know the concrete types that it uses. Instead, it relies on the abstractions. This means that it adheres to the Interface Segregation Principle and has a single responsibility: It can be responsible for booting up the system, without "also" creating its dependencies.
<br>

## 4. Describe the impact of _Dependency Injection_ on the maintainability of code.

**Dependency Injection** (DI) can greatly streamline the construction and maintenance of object-oriented systems, facilitating code that's modular, testable, and portable.

### Decoupling Elements for Code Maintenance

**Dependency injection** fosters a loosely-coupled system. Decoupled code separates concerns, domains, and responsibilities, which:

- **Simplifies Understanding**: Each part of the system can be designed and understood independently.
  
- **Eases Maintenance**: You can update one part of the code without impacting any other, reducing the chance of introducing bugs.

### Modular Code for Enhanced Maintainability

DI promotes modular design, where different pieces of code act as standalone, reusable modules known for their Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), i.e., one module, one responsibility.

- **Adherence to Best Practices**: Implementing modules that are small in scope with singular responsibilities reduces the need for complex, multi-threaded or multi-branch operations that are harder to maintain.

- **Ease of Troubleshooting**: Transparent module operations make identifying issues and bugs more straightforward.

### Code Reusability

By breaking the system into smaller, specialized modules, DI facilitates code reuse. This reduces redundancy and ensures consistency in function.

- **Centralized Logic**: Common functionalities are housed in standalone modules, diminishing the possibilities of divergent implementations in various parts of the codebase.

### Encouraging the Use of Interfaces

DI is best practiced using **interfaces** and **abstract classes** rather than concrete implementations. This enables more straightforward substitutions (commonly referred to as "loose coupling"). Loose coupling minimizes dependencies on specific implementations, making the system more adaptable and maintainable.

- **Improved Flexibility**: When combining several interacting objects in a system, leveraging interfaces or abstract classes allows substitutes without altering the reliant modules.
  
- **Streamlined Collaboration**: Uniform interfaces dictate how objects are expected to interact, ensuring seamless collaboration and minimizing potential miscommunications.

### Simplified Testing

DI naturally complements the concept of testing, playing a crucial role in optimizing and maintaining code functionality.

- **Enhanced Code Integrity**: By substituting actual dependencies with controlled or simulated ones during testing, DI makes it simpler to validate that modules function correctly in varying contexts. This method of substituting dependencies is called **"mocking"**.

- **Time and Resource Efficiency**: Independent testing of modules is facilitated, shortening the time required to identify bugs and decreasing the likelihood of dependencies between modules going undetected.

### Code Segregation for Clarity

DI encourages you to classify objects as services, repositories, controllers, and more. Each serves an organized purpose:

- **Clear Function Allocation**: Each object has a specific task, making it easier to troubleshoot and comprehend the codebase.

  - Example: In a web application, a `UserController` is responsible for handling user-related operations, and a `UserRepository` is exclusively in charge of database interactions related to users.

### Lifecycle Management for Efficient Resource Utilization

Objects within different scopes like singleton, transient or scoped are usually managed by the DI containers. Such a feature ensures efficient resource usage, leading to code that's easier to maintain.

- **Lifecycle Consistency**: When all dependencies adhere to a shared lifecycle, resource management is more uniform throughout the application.

### Demanding Transparency and Reducing Complexity

DI requires you to register explicit dependencies, cutting down on hidden "magic behavior." This transparency is critical for maintaining efficient, predictable modules.

### Code Example

Here is the Java code:

**Interface**: `IMessageService.java`

```java
public interface IMessageService {
    void sendMessage(String message);
}
```

**Service Class**: `EmailService.java`

```java
public class EmailService implements IMessageService {
    @Override
    public void sendMessage(String message) {
        // Email sending logic
        System.out.println("Email sent: " + message);
    }
}
```

**Consumer**: `MyApplication.java`

Here, instead of instantiating `EmailService` internally, it receives the `IMessageService` through its constructor, thus being DI-compliant.

```java
public class MyApplication {
    private final IMessageService messageService;

    public MyApplication(IMessageService messageService) {
        this.messageService = messageService;
    }

    public void sendMessageToUser(String user, String message) {
        // Logic to fetch user's email goes here
        // ...

        // Finally, send message using the injected service
        messageService.sendMessage(user + ": " + message);
    }
}
```
<br>

## 5. Can you explain the _Dependency Inversion Principle_ and how it differs from _Dependency Injection_?

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** and **Dependency Injection** are two design principles that play a pivotal role in object-oriented design. Let's explore the key concepts and their concordance.

### What is DIP?

The Dependency Inversion Principle formalizes the relationship between **higher-level modules** and **lower-level modules** through three key ideas:

- **Abstraction**: High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

- **No Concrete Dependencies**: High-level modules should not be directly tied to lower-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

- **Stability**: Abstractions are more stable than concrete implementations. This means once defined, abstractions should seldom change, ensuring minimal ripple effects in your codebase when there are changes.

### How DIP Differs from DI

- **Abstraction vs. Relationship Management**:
  - DIP: Focuses on separating the creation and management of dependencies.
  - DI: Concentrates on providing the necessary dependencies to a class without the class itself being concerned about their creation.

- **Direction of Dependencies**:
  - DIP: Establishes a top-down relationship, stating that higher-level modules should be independent of implementation details in lower-level modules.
  - DI: Provides a mechanism for the direction of dependencies to be abstracted away through various forms like constructor injection or setter injection.

#### Brief Look at DIP

- **Abstraction**: Using an interface like `IAuthenticationService` allows the `AuthenticationManager` to work with any concrete implementation that adheres to the contract set by the interface.

- **No Concrete Dependencies**: The `AuthenticationManager` is decoupled from the specific `AuthenticationService` implementation, achieving flexibility.

- **Stability**: By relying on `IAuthenticationService`, the `AuthenticationManager` isn't affected if a new `AuthenticationService` or its internal mechanism is introduced.

#### Brief Look at DI

The `AuthenticationManager` gets its `IAuthenticationService` through constructor injection. An external entity, often a DI container, is responsible for providing the concrete implementation, either directly or through a configured service provider.

The relationship is established by:

```java
public class AuthenticationManager {
    private IAuthenticationService authService;
    
    public AuthenticationManager(IAuthenticationService authService) {
        this.authService = authService;
    }
}
```

Whether it's pure manual DI or using a DI framework, the idea is to have a separate entity responsible for handling object creation and managing dependencies.

This separation of concerns aligns closely with the Dependency Inversion Principle, ensuring that high-level modules (like `AuthenticationManager`) are shielded from the volatility that might stem from changes in lower-level modules or their dependencies.
<br>

## 6. Compare and contrast _constructor injection_ versus _setter injection_.

Let's explore the key features and differences between **constructor injection** and **setter injection**.

### Constructor Injection

In this method, the container creates a service object by invoking the constructor and then **injects** it into the dependent class through the constructor.

Constructor injection often ensures that the dependent service is in a **valid state** before it's ever used, and it can also help maintain the **immutability** of objects. This approach is especially useful for required dependencies and can result in **simpler, more reliable** object configurations.

#### Code Example: Constructor Injection

Here is the Java code:

```java
public class UserService {
    private final UserRepository repository;
    
    // Constructor injection
    public UserService(UserRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }
}
```

### Setter Injection

With setter injection, the container uses the class's public setters to provide the dependencies.

Setter injection offers **flexibility** as dependencies are not required at object construction time, which can reduce the complexity of object creation. This approach is useful for handling **optional or changing dependencies**.

Setter injection can lead to objects being in an **inconsistent state** if a dependency is not set before it's used, leading to potential runtime errors. Meanwhile, setter methods could theoretically be called multiple times, potentially **overwriting** the existing dependency, a practice often discouraged.

#### Code Example: Setter Injection

Here is the Java Code:

```java
public class UserPreferenceService {
    private EmailService emailService;
    
    // Setter injection
    public void setEmailService(EmailService emailService) {
        this.emailService = emailService;
    }
}
```
<br>

## 7. When would you use _method injection_ instead of _constructor injection_?

Both **constructor and method injection** play crucial roles in structuring modern applications.

### Constructor Injection

- Ensures that a **dependency is received before the containing class or component is instantiated**.
- Often preferred for **mandatory dependencies** as it guarantees their presence.

### Method Injection

- Useful when certain dependencies are **optional** or only required during specific methods.
- May lead to a more **flexible design** and can be less rigid than constructor injection.
- Not suitable for every situation, it might introduce more complexity or create confusion.

### When to Use Method Injection

- **Optional Dependencies**: When a class has dependencies that are not always necessary.
  
- **Fluent APIs or Method Chaining**: For scenarios where you want to enable method chaining, and the next method may require specific dependencies.
  
- **Performance Tuning**: For specific classes or methods where you want to defer dependency resolution in favor of performance gains.

- **Temporal Associates**: When the need for dependencies is not consistent across the entire lifecycle of the object.

- **Granular Control Over Dependencies**: For use cases where different methods require different or specific dependencies.
<br>

## 8. Can mixing different types of injection in the same class lead to issues? If so, what kind?

While **using multiple types of dependency injections in a single class** is feasible, this ought to be done mindfully to prevent potential complications. 

### The Pitfalls

- **Confusion and Clutter**: Maintaining several patterns can be complex and might lead to code that is hard to read or test.
  
- **Ripple Effects**: Altering a single injection type might require changes in multiple segments of the code.
  
- **Potential for Early Initialization**: It might lead to components being created and initialized before they are needed.

- **Decoupling Breakdown**: This approach could make it more challenging to track dependencies and their sources.

### Best Practices

- **Strive for Uniformity**: If possible, select one approach and stick to it for consistency.
  
- **Prioritize Testability**: Ensure that the code remains easy to test and maintain, even with multiple injection types.

- **Controller-Like Segregation**: If certain classes primarily manage access to external resources or framework-specific components, isolate those with specific injection needs.

### Code Example: Multiple Dependency Injections

Here is the Java code:

1. The `NotificationService` needs persitence and logging dependencies, so it uses Constructor Injection.

   ```java
    public interface NotificationService {
        void sendNotification(String message);
    }

    public class EmailNotificationService implements NotificationService {
        private PersistenceService persistenceService;
        private LoggerService loggerService;
  
        public EmailNotificationService(PersistenceService persistenceService, LoggerService loggerService) {
            this.persistenceService = persistenceService;
            this.loggerService = loggerService;
        }
  
        public void sendNotification(String message) {
            // Send email with persistence and logging
        }
    }
    ```

2. The `ActionService` requires certain components to be instantiated early.

   ```java
   public class ActionService {
        private static HelperService notificationHelper;

        public static void initialize(HelperService service) {
            notificationHelper = service;
        }
  
        public void performAction() {
            // Use the notificationHelper.
        }
    }
    ```
3. `DataAnalytics` class has Institutional Control over logger injection, concrete class instantiated in the method body.

   ```java
   public class DataAnalytics {
        private final static DataLogger dataLogger = new DataLogger("DataLogger");

        public static void prepareData() {
            // Access the dataLogger instance.
        }
    }
    ```
<br>

## 9. Is there a preferred type of _dependency injection_ when working with _immutable objects_? Please explain.

**Constructor Injection** is the most suitable approach for **immutable objects**, as it provides a seamless method for initializing objects during their creation.

### Why Constructor Injection?

#### Guarantee of Initialization

- Using Constructor Injection ensures that **all mandatory dependencies** are provided at object creation. This makes the instance **ready for use right from the start** without needing additional steps.

- With other forms of dependency injection, such as Setter Injection, there's a possibility of failing to set all the required dependencies, leading to a partially initialized object.

#### Simplicity and Safety

- Constructor Injection offers a **simpler and safer** way to create immutable objects by ensuring that once constructed, an object's state remains unchanging.

- Other methods, like method or field injections, might force the object to be mutable, further leading to complicated state management and possibly undesirable behaviors.

### Code Example: Constructor Injection

Here is the Java code:

```java
public class Order {
    private final PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor;

    public Order(PaymentProcessor paymentProcessor) {
        this.paymentProcessor = paymentProcessor;
    }

    public void processOrder() {
        // Use the payment processor
    }
}
```
In this code snippet. the `Order` class uses Constructor Injection to initialize its immutable `paymentProcessor` attribute.
<br>

## 10. How does each type of _dependency injection_ affect the ease of _unit testing_?

Let's look at the **three forms** of Dependency Injectionâ€”**constructor injection**, **setter injection**, and **interface-based injection**â€”and their impact on the **ease of unit testing**.

### The Three Types of Dependencies

1. **Constructor Injection**: 

Expect a high initialisation effort as it requires all dependencies to be defined during object creation. However, this strategy ensures that an object will always be in a valid state once constructed.

   ```java
   public class Example {
       private final Dependency dependency;
       
       public Example(Dependency dependency) {
           this.dependency = dependency;
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Setter Injection**:

This method, achieved using **setter methods**, can sometimes lead to objects being left in an invalid state. However, it is the **most** appropriate choice when collaborators are **optional**.

   ```java
   public class Example {
       private Dependency dependency;
       
       public void setDependency(Dependency dependency) {
           this.dependency = dependency;
       }
   }
   ```

Check if the dependency is set before using it:

   ```java
   public void doSomething() {
       if (dependency != null) {
           dependency.performAction();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Interface-Based Injection**:

Requires a **separate interface** for each dependency. It ensures the presence of a required dependency and works best for **configurable** or **interchangeable** components.

   ```java
   public interface Dependency {
       void performAction();
   }
   
   public class Example {
       private final Dependency dependency;
       
       public Example(Dependency dependency) {
           this.dependency = dependency;
       }
   }
   ```
<br>

## 11. What is a _Dependency Injection container_ and what are its responsibilities?

A **Dependency Injection Container** automates the injection of dependencies into objects, streamlining software design and eliminating direct object references. Often, these containers are an imperative part of **Inversion of Control** (IoC) frameworks.

### Components

- **Provider**: Serves as the factory for dependent objects.
- **Registry**: Holds mappings of **interfaces** or **abstract classes** to **implementations** or **concrete classes**.
- **Injector**: Traverses and inserts dependencies into dependent objects.

### Container Responsibilities

1. **Component Configuration**: Accepts **registrations** and **configures** how to build dependent objects.
2. **Dependency Lookup**: Selects and retrieves dependencies.
3. **Dependency Composition**: Builds objects, injecting their dependencies as per the registration rules.

### Key Concepts

- **Service**: A **dependency** provided by the container.
- **Service Provider**: An object capable of creating or retrieving a specific **service**.

### Why Use a DI Container?

- **Encapsulation**: Conceals object creation, promoting tighter control and encapsulation.
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies complex setups and reduces the need for manual object construction.

### Code Example: Without a DI Container

Here is a Java code:

```java
public class ShoppingCartService {
    private final PaymentGateway paymentGateway;

    public ShoppingCartService() {
        this.paymentGateway = new PaymentGateway();
    }
}
```

The problem with the above code is that `ShoppingCartService` has a hard dependency on `PaymentGateway`, making it difficult to test and making the `PaymentGateway` harder to mock.

### Code Example: With a DI Container

Here is the Java code:

```java
public class ShoppingCartService {
    private final PaymentGateway paymentGateway;

    public ShoppingCartService(PaymentGateway paymentGateway) {
        this.paymentGateway = paymentGateway;
    }
}
```

And the usage with a DI container:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Container container = new DIContainer();
        ShoppingCartService shoppingCartService = container.resolve(ShoppingCartService.class);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `ShoppingCartService` is provided with a `PaymentGateway` instance via the DI container, removing its dependency on object creation.
<br>

## 12. Can you list some popular _Dependency Injection frameworks_ and their distinctive features?

<br>

## 13. What is the difference between a _Dependency Injection container_ and a _service locator_?

Let's look at the differences between **Dependency Injection (DI) containers** and **Service Locators**.

### Core Mechanism

**DI Container** abstracts object creation and resolution. It focuses on supplying dependencies either implicitly through configuration or explicitly using annotations or rules.

In contrast, a **Service Locator** acts as a central registry. It locates (or "pulls") services or dependencies as needed.

### Lifecycle Management

While **DI containers** often cater to a variety of lifecycles, ensuring each dependency is available when required, a **Service Locator** stands neutral to concerns such as when to create or dispose of objects. This responsibility then falls back on the client utilizing the located service.

### Code Integrity

With a **DI container**, dependencies in an object are discernible either through the constructor, properties, or methods. This transparency aids in compile-time verification and static code analysis.

A **Service Locator**, on the other hand, might hide direct dependency representations, instead offering a more dynamic, runtime-based approach. This effect could diminish code predictability and potential benefits of early error detection.

### Inversion of Control (IoC) & Dependency Management

**DI containers** are seen as an embodiment of Inversion of Control. They take charge of creating and linking dependencies, relieving the object from its direct creation responsibilities.

In contrast, a **Service Locator** doesn't shift control of dependencies; it provides a direct method of access, allowing objects to demand their requirements.

### System Integration

A well-structured **DI** system usually integrates with the broader context of an application, setting the stage for more thorough **component testing** and **separation of concerns**.

The **Service Locator** may not provide a clear-cut component isolation mechanism. Its usage might incline towards a more global mode, introducing a risk of tight coupling within the application.

### Performance Considerations

Frequent usage of a **Service Locator** in dynamically retrieving dependencies can potentially lead to **performance overhead** compared to a pre-configured DI container.

## 14. How do you configure dependencies within a _DI container_ typically?

In typical scenarios, you **configure** dependencies within a **Dependency Injection (DI) container** through one of three mechanisms: Annotation, XML, or Service Descriptor (such as in Angular & Spring). Internally, the container uses **reflection** to understand and integrate the linked components.

For instance, in **Java EE** or **Spring**, XML is optionally used in conjunction with annotations to configure dependencies.

### Mechanisms for Dependency Configuration

#### Annotations

Films a direct link between components, and is often favored for its simplicity.

**Example**:
- **Java**: `@Inject`
- **C#**: `DependencyAttribute`

#### XML-Based Configuration

Offers a global view of the dependencies, but can be cumbersome to maintain in large systems.

**Example**:
- **Java EE**
  
  ```xml
    <class>
      <class-name>com.acme.MyMojo</class-name>
      ...
    </class>
  ```

- **Spring**

  ```xml
  <bean id="customer" class="com.acme.MyMojo" />
  ```

#### Service Descriptors

A compact, standardized approach using configuration classes or decorators.

**Example**:
- **Angular**

  ```typescript
  @NgModule({
    providers: [MyService]
  })
  export class AppModule { }
  ```

- **Spring**

  ```java
  @Configuration
  public class AppConfig {
      @Bean
      public MyBean myBean() {
          return new MyBean();
      }
  }
  ```

## 15. Describe a situation where you should opt for a lightweight _DI container_ over a full-fledged framework.

While full-fledged **DI frameworks** are comprehensive and feature-rich, they may be overkill for simpler projects. In such cases, a **lightweight DI container** offers a versatile and efficient alternative.

### When to Choose a Lightweight DI Container

- **Small to Medium Projects**: For straightforward applications with fewer moving parts and dependencies, a lightweight container keeps things simple without unnecessary complexity.

- **Rapid Prototyping**: In the early stages of a project, speed is crucial. A lightweight container allows for quick setup and iteration.

- **Performance-Critical Systems**: For applications that require minimal overhead and swift execution, a slim DI container can be the better choice.

- **Learning and Understanding DI**: If you're new to dependency injection and want to grasp the core concepts before delving into more advanced features, a lightweight container provides a focused learning experience.

- **Customized Configurability**: Lighter containers offer the capability to fine-tune how objects and their dependencies are wired up, providing developers with granular control.

- **Mixed Environments**: Sometimes, you might be working on a project where the team uses different DI strategies. In such cases, a lightweight container can serve as a middle-ground, accommodating varying preferences.

### Example: Using `Dagger` Over `Spring` for an `Android` Project

In Android development, efficiency and app size are paramount. For a smaller app or in cases where you're particularly conscious of the app's package size, the lightweight **Dagger DI framework** wins over the extensively-featured **Spring**.

**Dagger** allows for compile-time validation, minimizing the risk of runtime errors, which is a distinct advantage in this context. It's tailored to the needs of Android development.
