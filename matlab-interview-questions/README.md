% Perform Linear Regression
X = [ones(length(x), 1), x']; % Design matrix
coefficients = X\y'; % Coefficients for the linear model: y = b0 + b1*x
```
<br>

## 9. Explain how _matrix operations_ are performed in _MATLAB_.

**MATLAB** is optimized for matrix computations, making it an ideal tool for linear algebra, signal processing, data analysis, and machine learning.

### Key Matrix Operations in MATLAB

1. **Matrix-Matrix Product**: Uses the `*` operator.

    ```matlab
    A = [3, 1; 2, 1];
    B = [2, 4; 1, 2];
    C = A*B;
    ```

2. **Element-Wise Multiplication**: Uses the `.*` operator.

    ```matlab
    A = [1, 2; 3, 4];
    B = [2, 0; -1, 5];
    C = A.*B;
    ```

3. **Transpose**: Uses the single-quote `'` operator or `.'` for conjugate transpose.

    ```matlab
    A = [1, 2; 3, 4];
    B = A';
    ```

4. **Inverse**:

    ```matlab
    A = [1, 3; 2, 4];
    B = inv(A);
    ```

5. **Matrix Division**:
   
   - **Left Division** (`B/A`) solves for $X$ in $AX = B$.
   - **Right Division** (`A\B`) solves for $X$ in $XA = B$.

6. **Diagonal Matrices**:

    - Construct with `diag`.
    - Extract with `diag`.

    ```matlab
    A = magic(3);
    D = diag(A);
    ```

7. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**:

    ```matlab
    [V, D] = eig(A);
    ```

8. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**:
   
    ```matlab
    [U, S, V] = svd(A);
    ```

9. **Sparse matrices**: Optimized for datasets with many zero-elements.

   - Use `sparse` to declare a sparse matrix.
   - Conversion methods like `full` to change representation.

    ```matlab
    A_full = full(A_sparse);
    ```

10. **Matrix Norms**:

    ```matlab
    norm(A);  % 2-norm (largest singular value)
    norm(A, 1);  % 1-norm (largest column sum)
    ```

11. **Solving Linear Systems**:

    ```matlab
    x = A\b;  % Solve AX = B for X
    ```

12. **Selection and Slicing**:

    - Uses standard indexing, starting from 1.
    - Matrix concatenation with `[]`.

13. **Matrix Power**:

    ```matlab

    B = A^2;
    ```

14. **Trace**:

    ```matlab
    tr_A = trace(A);
    ```

### Vectorization for Efficiency

- MATLAB employs vectorized operations, potentially improving performance.
- It's recommended to leverage this feature by avoiding `for` loops and using matrix and element-wise operations whenever possible.

### Errors and Singular Matrices

- **Inversion**: MATLAB's `inv` might return the Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse for non-invertible or near-singular matrices if the computed matrix has small singular values.
- **Division**: Division by zero or singular matrices can be handled by utilizing pseudoinverses or LSQ approximate solutions.
<br>

## 10. What are _element-wise operations_, and how do you perform them in _MATLAB_?

**Element-wise operations** involve performing an operation separately on each element of a matrix or array. This concept is central to **vectorized computing**, creating efficient, fast and concise code.

### Element-Wise Operation List

1. **Square:** Element-wise squaring
    - MATLAB: `A .^ 2`

2. **Addition**: Adding a scalar to each element
    - MATLAB: `A + 5`

3. **Multiplication**: Multiplying each element by a scalar
    - MATLAB: `A * 0.5`

4. **Exponential**: Element-wise exponentiation
    - MATLAB: `exp(A)`

5. **Trigonometric Functions**: Sine, cosine, tangent - element-wise
    - MATLAB: `sin(A)`

### Advanced Operations

    - MATLAB: `A * B`
<br>

## 11. How would you _reshape_ a _matrix_ in _MATLAB_ without changing its data?

In MATLAB, you can **reshape** a matrix without altering its data with the `reshape` function. For example, you can transform a $3 \times 3$ matrix into a $9 \times 1$ vector, a $1 \times 9$ row vector, or a $9 \times 1$ column vector.

### Sample Code

Here is the MATLAB code:

```matlab
% Original 3x3 matrix
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9];

% Flattened row vector
A_flat_row = reshape(A, 1, []);

% Flattened column vector
A_flat_col = reshape(A, [], 1);

% Column vector alternative
A_flat_col_alt = reshape(A.', [], 1);

% Emulate flattening
A_flat_manual = A.';

% Retain original shape
A_new = reshape(A_flat_manual, size(A));

% Display results
disp('Original 3x3 matrix:');
disp(A);
disp('Flattened as a row vector:');
disp(A_flat_row);
disp('Flattened as a column vector:');
disp(A_flat_col);
disp('Flattened as a column vector without transposing:');
disp(A_flat_col_alt);
disp('Restored from manual flattening:');
disp(A_new);
```
<br>

## 12. Discuss the uses of the '_find_' function in _MATLAB_.

The `find` function in MATLAB is a powerful tool for array indexing and boolean-based querying. Whether you're manipulating arrays, applying logical operations, or need to identify specific elements, `find` offers a versatile and efficient solution.

### 1. Basic Usage

The primary role of `find` is to locate **non-zero elements** in a logical context or **specific values** in an array-like context.

```matlab
A = [1 0 3 0 5];
idx = find(A); % Output: [1 3 5]

B = [10 20 30; 40 50 60];
[row, col] = find(B > 40);
% Output: row = [2; 2; 2], col = [2; 3; 3]
```

### 2. Advanced Features

  - **Multiple Outputs**: Bound two separate outputs to capture row and column indices, great for matrix operations.
  - **Specific Modes**: Operates in logical or index return mode, adjusting output type as needed.
  - **Mask-Based Filtering**: Use logical arrays to sieve through data, a technique especially helpful for non-numeric data.

### 3. Performance Considerations

Ultimately, the choice between `find` and vectorized logical indexing comes down to the **proportion of non-zero elements** and the data size. For smaller data sets, simpler approaches might fare better.

### 4. Code Example: Using 'find'

Here is the MATLAB code:

```matlab
% Generating Example Data
matSize = 1000;
A = randi([0 1], matSize, matSize); % Random binary matrix

% Using find
tic, [r, c] = find(A); toc; % Timing the process

% Using Vectorized Logical Indexing
tic, [r_v, c_v] = find(A); toc; % Timing the process
```
<br>

## 13. Explain the concept of _broadcasting_ in _MATLAB_.

**Broadcasting** describes the way MATLAB performs operations between arrays of different shapes or sizes.

### How Broadcasting Works

1. **Equalizing Dimensions**: MATLAB pads the smaller array with ones to match the size of the larger array along each dimension. For example, a $3 \times 1$ array might be padded to $1 \times 3$ or $3 \times 3$.

2. **Operating Element-Wise**: After the dimension matching, MATLAB performs element-wise operations across all pairs of corresponding dimensions. If a dimension has size 1 in one array, it's effectively repeated to match the other size or form a singleton expansion.

3. **Memory Optimization**: MATLAB doesn't create a new array during singleton expansion, which both conserves memory and improves computational efficiency.

### An Example

Consider the operation $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{B}$, where:

$$
$$
\mathbf{A} &= \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
\end{bmatrix} \\
\mathbf{B} &= \begin{bmatrix}
10 \\
20 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$

Due to different dimensions, MATLAB will adjust the arrays into **broadcasting-compatible shapes** before element-wise multiplication:

$$
$$
\bar{\mathbf{A}} &= \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
\end{bmatrix} \\
\bar{\mathbf{B}} &= \begin{bmatrix}
10 & 10 & 10 \\
20 & 20 & 20 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
$$

After dimension adjustment, the operation becomes:

$$
\bar{\mathbf{A}} \cdot \bar{\mathbf{B}} = \begin{bmatrix}
10 & 20 & 30 \\
80 & 100 & 120 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

MATLAB also handles broadcasting in more complex scenarios, allowing for efficient operations between multi-dimensional arrays.

### Visual Representation

Matlab uses the following example to illustrate how broadcasting is done.
```matlab
A = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]; 
B = [1 0 1];
C = A.*B;
disp(C)
```

It helps visualize the broadcasting process with illustrations.
<br>

## 14. What is the purpose of the '_eig_' function, and how is it used?

In MATLAB, the **eig** $A$ function is a core component of eigenvalue and eigenvector computation. It achieves this through characterizing the **eigensystem** of a given matrix.

For a given square matrix $A$, the **eig** function yields both the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It's worth noting that the function's return format is different based on a few specific input parameters.

### Core Functionality

- **_Eigenvalues_**: The most straightforward application of the **eig** function generates only the eigenvalues:
  ```matlab
  eig(A)
  ```

- **_Eigenvectors_**: You can obtain the eigenvectors alongside the eigenvalues. The syntax involves using two output variables:
  ```matlab
  [V, D] = eig(A)
  ```

  Here, $V$ is the matrix of eigenvectors, and $D$ is the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues.

### Equations and Methodology

The function utilizes various mathematical methods tailored to the matrix type. For instance:

- **_Symmetric Matrices_**: Thanks to their symmetry, these matrices can be decomposed directly, typically exploiting the rotational equations to uncover the eigensystem.

- **_General Matrices_**: Various algorithms come into play, like the QR iteration method and more refined strategies tailored to specific matrix characteristics.

### Code Example: Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors

Here is the MATLAB code:

  ```matlab
  A = [4 2; 3 -1];
  [V, D] = eig(A);
  V
  D
  ```
<br>

## 15. How do you create a basic _plot_ in _MATLAB_?

To create a basic plot in MATLAB, you can use the `plot` function or its variants, such as `stem` for discrete data or `loglog` for logarithmic scales.

For this example, let's consider the simple function $y = x^2$.

### MATLAB Code

Here is the MATLAB code:

```matlab
% Generate Data
x = -10:0.1:10;
y = x.^2;

% Plot Data
plot(x,y, 'LineWidth', 2);  % Line thickness
title('Square Function - y = x^2');  % Add a title
xlabel('x');  % X-axis label
ylabel('y');  % Y-axis label

% Grid and Aspect Ratio
grid on;  % Turn on grid
axis equal;  % Set aspect ratio to 1:1
```

### Customizations

-  The `LineWidth` property controls line thickness.
-  `title`, `xlabel`, and `ylabel` add text to the graph.
-  `axis equal` ensures a 1:1 aspect ratio.

### Other Plot Types

-  `stem` produces a **discrete plot**.
-  `loglog` displays data on **logarithmic scales**.
-  `semilogx` and `semilogy` show data on specific logarithmic axes.
