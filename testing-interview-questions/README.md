- `Continuous Improvement`

### Areas of Testing

1. **Unit Testing**: Involves testing individual components or modules in isolation.
2. **Integration Testing**: Ensures that different parts of the system work together smoothly.
3. **System Testing**: Validates the product as a whole, usually in an environment closely resembling the production setting.
4. **Acceptance Testing**: Confirms that the system meets specific business requirements, making this the final validation phase before release.
5. **Performance Testing**: Assesses how the system performs under various load conditions.
6. **Security Testing**: Checks for vulnerabilities that could lead to breaches or data compromises.
7. **Usability Testing**: Focuses on how user-friendly the system is.

### Common Misconceptions about Testing

1. **Role Misinterpretation**: Often seen as the epithet for Bug Tracking, Testing digs deeper into Risk Management, Requirement Analysis and Customer Feedback Handling.

2. **Test Setup Cost**: Initial test setup may appear costly. It is worth investing to avoid higher costs due to system crash or customer retention issues.

3. **Defect Discovery Fallacy**: **Zero Defect** assertion after testing is unrealistic. A critical awareness is: "*We can't ensure the absence of all defects, but we work tirelessly to minimize these occurrences.*"

4. **Static Analysis Pitfall**: Automated scans and code reviews offer a wealth of data but doesn't replace dynamic testing that mimics and inspects live executions.

5. **Elimination of Manual Testing**: While Automated Testing is robust, the human intellect from exploratory tests gives an edge in uncovering unexpected anomalies.

6. **Sprint or Time-Based Delimitation**: Testing is viewed as an ongoing process, steadily integrated with Development, investing in every unit engineered.

### Skillset Proficiency

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Composing tests even before building the code can steer a clear development path, magnifying code quality and reduction of bugs.

2. **Agile and DevOps Synthesis**: Seamless interaction among Development, Testing and Deployment is possible through such cohesive environments.

3. **Domain Knowledge Fundamentals**: Such expertise aids in meticulous scenario outlining and certification of systems.
<br>

## 2. Define the difference between _verification_ and _validation_ in software testing.

Let's define **verification** and **validation** in the context of software testing and distinguish between the two.

### Core Distinctions

- **Verification**: Confirms that the software adheres to its specifications and requirements.
  - It answers "Are we building the product right?"
  - Examples: Code reviews, inspections, and walkthroughs.

- **Validation**: Ensures that the software meets the user's actual needs.
  - It answers "Are we building the right product?"
  - Examples: User acceptance testing, alpha and beta testing.
<br>

## 3. Explain the _software development life cycle_ and the role testing plays in each phase.

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is comprised of several distinct phases that lay the foundation for a successful software project.

### Key Phases

1. **Requirement Analysis & Planning**:  
   - **Stakeholder Consultation**: Engaging with stakeholders to fully understand their needs and expectations, and to establish clear project objectives.
   - **Testing Role**: Requirement validation via techniques like Prototype Evaluation and Use Case Analysis.

2. **Design & Architectural Planning**:  
   - **Document Creation**: This involves creating the Software Requirement Specification (SRS) and the High-Level Design document.
   - **Testing Role**: Design Reviews and Structural Testing ensure the project's design aligns with the defined requirements.

3. **Implementation & Coding**:  
   - **Core Functionality**: The focus here is on writing code to cater to validated and approved requirements.
   - **Unit Testing**: Small, independent units of code are tested to confirm they meet their expected behaviors, ensuring reliable building blocks for the larger system.

4. **System Testing**: The integrated system is tested as a whole, to ensure all features work together cohesively.
   - **Phase Segmentation**:  This is often divided into Alpha & Beta Testing before release.
   - **Stress Testing**: Conducting experiments in extreme conditions helps assess the system's limits.

5. **Deployment & Maintenance**:  
   - **Deployment Verification**: Post-deployment tests are conducted to ensure that the system functions correctly in its live environment.
   - **Regular Checks**: Ongoing maintenance includes periodic checks and updates to keep the software optimized and secure.

### Code Example: Unit Testing

Here is the Python code:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

# Unit Tests
assert add(1, 2) == 3
assert subtract(5, 2) == 3
```

### Code Example: Integration Testing

Here is the Python code:

```python
def add_and_subtract(a, b):
    return add(a, b), subtract(a, b)

# Integration Test
result = add_and_subtract(5, 3)
assert result == (8, 2)
```
<br>

## 4. What are the different _levels of software testing_?

<br>

## 5. Describe the difference between _static_ and _dynamic testing_.

**Static testing** and **dynamic testing** complement each other to deliver comprehensive code verification. Whereas **static testing** focuses on examining software without executing it, **dynamic testing** verifies software in an operational environment. Let's explore these two approaches in more detail.

### Core Focus

- **Static Testing**: Analyzes code or documentation to identify issues without executing the program.
- **Dynamic Testing**: Involves code execution to identify and evaluate program behavior.

### Timing

- **Static Testing**: Typically conducted earlier in the development cycle, aiding in identifying issues at their root.
- **Dynamic Testing**: Typically performed later in the development cycle, after code integration, to assess system functionality and user interaction.

### Tools and Techniques

#### Static Testing

- **Manual Reviews**: Human experts manually inspect code and documentation.
- **Automated Tools**: Software applications are used to analyze code or documentation for possible issues. Examples include code linters, IDE integrations, and spell-checkers for documentation.

#### Dynamic Testing

- ** Unit Testing**: Evaluates the smallest units of code, such as individual functions or methods, in isolation.
- **Integration Testing**: Validates that modules or components work together as expected.
- ** System Testing**: Assesses the complete, integrated software product to ensure it meets predefined requirements.
- **Acceptance Testing**: Determines if a system meets a set of business requirements and/or user expectations. It often involves end-users executing the system.

### Code Coverage

- **Static Testing**: Offers some line coverage to ensure that all code is correct and complete, but does not guarantee execution.
- **Dynamic Testing**: Provides comprehensive execution, ensuring that code is run as intended under different scenarios.

### Test Objectives

- **Static Testing**: Primarily aims to identify issues such as code violations, design errors, and documentation problems.
- **Dynamic Testing**: Seeks to validate system functionality and user interaction in a real or simulated environment.
<br>

## 6. What is a _test case_, and what elements should it contain?

A **test case** represents a single lookup procedure for issues and errors.

Each test case should encompass specific attributes to ensure its efficacy as a validation tool in the **software testing** process:

- **ID**: Unique identifier, possibly generated by an automated system.
- **Title**: Descriptive summary of the test case.
- **Description**: Detailed account of the test case purpose, prerequisite steps, and expected outcomes.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Procedural guide to replicate the test environment and provoke the expected result.
- **Expected Outcome**: Clearly defined desired or optimal test result or post-test state.
- **Actual Outcome**: Recorded results from test execution for comparison with the **expected outcome**.
- **Comments**: Space for the addition of ancillary information relating to the test case or its particular actions.
- **Assigned To**: Identification of the tester or group responsible for executing the test case.
- **Last Updated**: Timestamp noting the most recent alteration to the test case, including modifications to any of its elements.

### Code Example: Test Case Attributes

Here is the Java code:

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class TestCase {
    private int id;
    private String title;
    private String description;
    private List<String> stepsToReproduce;
    private String expectedOutcome;
    private String actualOutcome;
    private String comments;
    private String assignedTo;
    private LocalDateTime lastUpdated;

    // Constructor, getters and setters
}
```
<br>

## 7. Explain the concept of _coverage_ in testing and the main types of coverage (e.g., line, branch, path, statement).

**Coverage testing** involves evaluating the extent to which pieces of code are executed. This assessment helps in identifying areas of code that are not tested.

Key metrics for coverage include:

- **Line coverage**: The percentage of executable lines of code that are exercised by a test suite.

- **Branch coverage**: The percentage of decision points in the code where both possible outcomes have been tested at least once.

- **Path coverage**: This is the ideal scenario where every possible path through a program has been executed at least once. Achieving comprehensive path coverage can be impractical for larger programs.

- **Statement coverage**: The simplest type of coverage, evaluating if each statement in the program has been executed at least once during testing.
<br>

## 8. What is the difference between _white-box_, _black-box_, and _grey-box testing_?

**White-box**, **black-box**, and **grey-box** testing serve different purposes and are often used in tandem.

### Black-Box Testing

In **Black-Box testing**, the tester is unfamiliar with the internal workings of the system. Tests are designed based on the system's specifications or requirements, ensuring that both the functional and non-functional requirements are met. 

This type of testing is commonly performed during early development stages.


### White-Box Testing

**White-Box testing** requires in-depth understanding of the internal structures of the system or software under test.

It is a structural testing method that ensures all or most paths and operations within the software are tested. 

This testing method is also known as clear box testing, and glass box testing, and is more appropriate for later stages in the software development lifecycle.

### Grey-Box Testing

In **Grey-Box testing**, the tester has access to some internal structures or algorithms of the software under test.

This kind of testing strives to achieve a balance between test coverage and system functionality. It combines the benefits of both **white-box** and **black-box** approaches.

Grey-Box testing is considered the most practical for real-world scenarios, especially when testing web applications, APIs, or distributed systems.
<br>

## 9. What is _regression testing_, and why is it performed?

**Regression testing** is a specialized testing mechanism designed to ensure that recent code changes do not adversely impact the existing functionality of a system.

### Core Goals

1. **Stability Assurance**: Verifying that modifications don't introduce new defects and issues.
2. **Consistency Check**: Ensuring unchanged features maintain their intended behavior.
3. **Prevention of Software Degradation**: Identifying areas where changes break established features.

### Common Triggers for Regression Testing

- **Defect Resolution**: Upon fixing a bug, testing other areas to confirm no new faults emerged.
- **Feature Enhancements**: Implementing new functionality while certifying existing features continue to work unaltered.
- **Code Refactoring**: Maintaining previous functionality after making structural or architectural modifications.

### Methods of Regression Testing

#### Complete

The exhaustive testing of all functionalities within an application. Although thorough, this method is time-consuming and often impractical for larger systems.

#### Selective

Targeting specific features or components known to interact with the newly modified code segments. This approach is more efficient but requires careful identification of relevant test scenarios.

#### Unit-Test-Driven Regression

Relies on the continuous and automated execution of unit tests. This ensures prompt detection of regressions during development, enabling quick rectification.

The selective approach is common in industry as complete testing is often infeasible or unnecessarily time-consuming.

### Tools for Automation

```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class MathFunctionsTest {
    MathFunctions mathFunctions = new MathFunctions();

    @Test
    void testAdd() {
        assertEquals(4, mathFunctions.add(2, 2));
    }

    @Test
    void testIsPrime() {
        assertTrue(mathFunctions.isPrime(7));
    }
}
```

### Tools for Automation

## 11. What is _integration testing_ and what are its types?

**Integration testing** evaluates the combined functionality of software components to identify any **interfacial issues** and ensure that they **work seamlessly** together. 

By testing groups of components as a unit,  integration testing aims to:

- Identify defects in component interactions.
- Verify that messages/requests are passed correctly.
- Assess systems for correct resource allocation and management.

### Types of Integration Testing

#### Top-Down Strategies


Advantages:

- Easier to identify and rectify architectural issues early on.
- Useful for monitoring the overall progress of the project.

Disadvantages:

- It may be complex to manage, especially in larger systems.

#### Top-Down Testing

Also known as "Big Bang Integration Testing," this strategy focuses on **testing upper layers of the application first**.

It involves:

1. Relying on **stubs** to simulate lower-level modules (these are temporary stand-ins for actual lower modules).
2. **Successive integration** of lower-level modules, systematically reducing the number of stubs.

#### Bottom-Up Testing

This strategy, known as "Incremental Integration Testing," follows the **opposite** approach, testing lower layers first:

1. Form initial test bases using modules from **the bottom**.
2. Use **drivers** as temporary surrogates for higher-level components.
3. **Gradually integrate** modules upwards.

#### Middle-Out Testing

The "Sandwich" or "Middleware" strategy integrates modules **layer-by-layer**, starting with the core and expanding outwards.

- Offers a balanced perspective.
- Ensures the core is robust first.

#### Hybrid Approaches

In reality, integration testing often employs **several methodologies** to achieve the most comprehensive coverage:

- **Federated**: Begins with vertical slices of the application, followed by vertical and horizontal integrations.
- **Concentric**: Works from the inside out or outside in, focusing on specific zones or areas of the application.

### Code Example: Top-Down and Bottom-Up Testing

Here is the Java code:

```java
// Top-Down Testing
public class SalesReportServiceTest {
    // Test dependency to CashierService
}

// Bottom-Up Testing
public class CashierServiceTest {
    // Test core functionality
}
```
<br>

## 12. What is _system testing_, and how does it differ from other types of testing?
