## 1. What is _Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)_?

**Windows Communication Foundation (WCF)** is a framework provided by Microsoft for building service-oriented applications. It enables you to build secure and reliable web services for inter-process communication within and across systems.

### Core Components

1. **Service Contract**: Defines what operations a service can perform.
2. **Data Contract**: Defines the types of data that will be exchanged.
3. **Message Contract**: Provides control over the SOAP header.
4. **Fault Contract**: Specifies errors raised by the service.
5. **Service Host**: Enables hosting the service in various environments like IIS, Console, or Windows Service.

### WCF Communication Stack

WCF has an extensible architecture, with three core components:

1. **Transport Layer**: Handles physical communication like TCP/IP, HTTP, and MSMQ.
2. **Message Encoder**: Converts messages to and from the wire format.
3. **Protocols**: Implements SOAP standards.

### WCF Hosting Options

1. **IIS Hosting**: The service is hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS).
2. **Self-Hosting**: The service is hosted in a separate process, like a Windows Service or Console Application. This method is useful for development and testing.
3. **Windows Service Hosting**: The service is hosted in a Windows Service for long-running tasks or background processing.

### Three Main Communication Styles

1. **One-Way Communication**: Send operations without expecting a return message.
2. **Duplex Communication**: Establish bi-directional communication channels.
3. **Request-Reply Communication**: Standard client-server model with request and response.

### Configurations Modes

1. **Imperative**: You configure services and clients in code.
2. **Declarative**: Settings are defined in an XML file. This is a preferred approach as it separates configuration from code, offering more flexibility.
   
### Development of Web Services

For building and consuming web services in WCF, Visual Studio uses two primary project templates:

1. **WCF Service Application**: This is used to host services within IIS.
2. **WCF Service Library**: This is used to define services without hosting, making it suitable for unit tests and debugging.

### Flow of Operation

1. **Service Model**: Configurations like defining endpoints, contracts, and behaviors.
2. **Transport**: Manages client-to-server communication, with the ability to add custom behaviors.
3. **Security**: Enforces various security options like encryption, authentication, and authorization.

### Features

- **Extensibility**: WCF is designed to allow for different types of extensions, such as transport and message encoders.
- **Interoperability**: It supports different protocols, ensuring communication between different platforms.
- **Flexibility**: It's highly adaptable to specific project needs.
- **Versioning**: Provides mechanisms for upgrading and maintaining old service versions.
- **Fault Tolerance**: WCF supports retry behaviors and offers fault contracts for better error handling.

### Code Example: WCF Service Contract

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
[ServiceContract]
public interface IMyService
{
    [OperationContract]
    List<string> GetNames();

    [OperationContract]
    void AddName(string name);
}
```
<br>

## 2. How is _WCF_ different from _ASP.NET Web Services_?

Both Windows Communication Foundation (**WCF**) and **ASP.NET Web Services** provide the means for applications to communicate with each other using web standards. However, they differ in various aspects.

### Key Distinctions

#### Flexibility

- **WCF**: Offers a higher degree of flexibility, enabling you to define more intricate communication patterns.
- **ASP.NET Web Services**: Primarily supports simpler, standardized methods such as SOAP-based services.

#### Hosting Options

- **WCF**: Ensures extensive flexibility in hosting options, supporting self-hosting and hosting in custom environments.
- **ASP.NET Web Services**: Typically are hosted within the IIS web server.

#### Transport Support

- **WCF**: Designed to work across various transports, be it HTTP, TCP, or named pipes.
- **ASP.NET Web Services**: Traditionally are best suited for HTTP but can be extended to support other transports.

#### Multipurpose Communication

- **WCF**: Equipped for both cross-network and cross-process communication, making it suitable for a broader range of applications.
- **ASP.NET Web Services**: More tailored for network applications and web service interoperability.
<br>

## 3. What are the key features of _WCF_?

**WCF (Windows Communication Foundation)**, part of the .NET framework, acts as a unified and service-oriented communication platform.

### Key Features of WCF

1. **Interoperability**:
   - WCF supports multiple protocols like HTTP, TCP, and more, allowing cross-platform communication.

2. **Multiple Message Exchange Patterns**: 
   - Supports one-way, request-reply, and duplex messaging.

3. **Service Disposition**:
   - WCF services can be Sessionful, Per-Call, or Singleton.

4. **Security Models**:

   - **Transport**: Provides secure communication channels, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and server authentication.
   - **Message**: Focuses on securing individual messages irrespective of the transport protocol.
   - **TransportWithMessageCredential**: A hybrid model combining the security of both transport and message.

5. **Component-Based Hosting**:
   - You can host WCF services in various components, like Windows Services, IIS, or within an application.

6. **Multiple Delivery Guarantees**:
   - WCF ensures delivery through a variety of guarantees (At-Most-Once, At-Least-Once, and Exactly-Once), depending on the chosen binding and configuration.

7. **Extensibility**:
   - Offers a comprehensive set of extensibility points, allowing for custom implementations of various infrastructure components.

8. **Client Proxy Generation**:
   - WCF generates client-side proxies to abstract network communication, making it easier for developers to invoke remote service methods.

9. **Concurrent Operations**:
   - WCF services can be configured to execute multiple requests concurrently, enhancing scalability.
 
 10. **Duplex Communication**:
   - Allows both the client and the server to send messages and invoke operations on each other. Useful for producing real-time applications.   
   
 11. **Exception Handling**:
   - Unhandled exceptions in WCF services are automatically converted to faults. This system-defined fault is transferred to the client, simplifying error management.

12. **Rich Integration with .NET Development**:
   - Seamlessly integrates with other .NET features and technologies such as WPF, WF, and ASP.NET.

13. **Built-in Serialization**:
   - Automatically handles the conversion of complex types and objects to and from their XML or binary representations.

14. **Reliability and Transactions**:
   - Offers support for transactions and reliable messaging, ensuring data consistency.

### Code Example: Enabling Session

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
// Define the service contract with session mode enabled
[ServiceContract(SessionMode = SessionMode.Required)]
public interface IMyService
{
    // Service operation requiring a session
    [OperationContract(IsInitiating = true, IsTerminating = false)]
    string JoinSession(string clientName);
}
```

### Code Example: Setting Up the Duplex Channel

Here is the C# code.

### Configurations

**App.config**:

```xml
<configuration>
  <system.serviceModel>
    <services>
      <service behaviorConfiguration="MyServiceBehavior" name="MyService">
        <host>
          <baseAddresses>
            <add baseAddress="http://localhost:8000/MyService"/>
          </baseAddresses>
        </host>

        <endpoint address=""
                  binding="wsDualHttpBinding"
                  contract="IMyService"
                  behaviorConfiguration="webHttp"/>

        <endpoint address="mex" binding="mexHttpBinding" contract="IMetadataExchange"/>
      </service>
    </services>

    <behaviors>
      <serviceBehaviors>
        <behavior name="MyServiceBehavior">
          <serviceMetadata httpGetEnabled="True"/>
          <serviceDebug includeExceptionDetailInFaults="False"/>
    </behavior>
  </serviceBehaviors>
</behaviors>

  <bindings>
    <wsDualHttpBinding>
      <binding name="webHttp">
        <security mode="None"/>
      </binding>
    </wsDualHttpBinding>
  </bindings>

</system.serviceModel>
</configuration>

```

**wcftestclient.exe.config**:

```xml
<configuration>
  <system.serviceModel>
    <client>
      <endpoint address="http://localhost:8000/MyService" binding="wsDualHttpBinding" contract="IMyService" behaviorConfiguration="webHttp"/>
    </client>
    <bindings>
      <wsDualHttpBinding>
        <binding name="webHttp"/>
      </wsDualHttpBinding>
    </bindings>
  </system.serviceModel>
</configuration>

```
<br>

## 4. Explain the concept of _service orientation_ in the context of _WCF_.

**WCF** services align closely with the **Service-Oriented Architecture** (SOA) approach. In SOA, services are independently deployable, self-contained, and include both data and functionality.

#### Key Features of Service Orientation

- **Autonomy**: Services are responsible for managing their own state and resources, reducing interdependence among components.
  
- **Discoverability**: Services need to broadcast what functionalities they offer, typically through well-defined and discoverable interfaces.

- **Contract-Driven Development**: Service interactions are governed by clearly defined contracts, promoting interoperability and loose-coupling among systems.

- **Statelessness** and **Idempotence**: Services should be designed to function without relying on the previous state or producing an impact multiple times under the same set of input parameters.

- **Conversationality**: It's about supporting long-running, multi-message interactions between clients and services.

- **Persistence**: The way services maintain and manage data and state.

- **Distribution and Location Transparency**: The end-user or calling component might not necessarily understand the physical location or distribution method of the service.

- **Liveness Awareness**. A service might need to dynamically discover other services, for example.

- **Coordination and Transactional Behavior**: It might be necessary to ensure that certain actions or sequences of steps across multiple services always happen together or not at all.

- **Reliability**: Services need to ensure consistent behaviors and reliable delivery of data and messages.

- **Monitoring**: This involves providing mechanisms for tracking the health and other relevant metrics of services.
<br>

## 5. What is a _service contract_ in _WCF_?

In the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), a **service contract** is an essential component that defines the operations the service can perform. It serves as a contract, ensuring that both the service and its clients adhere to the same set of operations and data exchange standards.

### Core Elements of a Service Contract

A service contract is defined by four key components:

1. **Service Interface**: This specifies the methods or operations that the service provides for both request-reply and one-way communication patterns.

2. **Message Exchange Patterns (MEPs)**: A service contract can define different message exchange patterns, including the traditional Request-Reply pattern and more streamlined One-Way patterns.

3. **Message Schemas**: These are defined using XML Schema and specify the structure of messages being sent and received.

4. **DataContract Attributes**: These provide additional control over data types that are exchanged in WCF operations.

### Service Contract Example

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
using System.ServiceModel;

// Define a service contract with specific operations and their message exchange patterns
[ServiceContract]
public interface IMyService 
{
    // Define a request-reply operation
    [OperationContract]
    string GetData(int value);

    // Define one-way operation
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void ProcessData(DataObject data);
}

// Define a data contract that describes the structure of exchanged data
[DataContract]
public class DataObject
{
    [DataMember]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [DataMember]
    public int Age { get; set; }
}
```

In this example:

- `IMyService` is the service contract that declares two operations. The `GetData` method uses a request-reply pattern, and `ProcessData` uses a one-way pattern.
- `DataObject` is the data contract that defines a structured data format used in the `ProcessData` method.

### Code Breakdown

- The `IExtensibleDataObject` interface is an optional contract that extends data serialization capabilities. It is used to store the data that is not part of the data contract. 
- The ServiceContract attribute marks the interface or the class (containing the methods) as a service contract. It supports properties like `Namespace`, `Name`, `ConfigurationNamespace`, and `ProtectionLevel`.

- The DataContract attribute marks a class to be included in data contracts for serialization and deserialization processes. It includes properties and fields. You can further control the individual members using the DataMember attribute. Its properties include `Name`, `IsRequired`, `EmitDefaultValue`, `Order`, and `ProtectionLevel`.

- The OperationContract attribute marks methods within a service contract as operations. It includes properties like `Name`, `Action`, `AsyncPattern`, `IsOneWay`, and `ProtectionLevel`.

  - Actions specify the SOAP action for each operation. If not specified, WCF chooses an action based on other features of the message, allowing the same contract-based service to respond to multiple action values.

**Tip**: Always annotate your contracts and data contracts with precise metadata to ensure consistent behavior across WCF services and clients.
<br>

## 6. Define a _data contract_ in _WCF_.

A **data contract** in WCF is an interoperable agreement that bridges communication gaps between different systems. It **standardizes message formats** to ensure various systems can **interpret and process data** uniformly.

### Core Components

- **Data Members**: These are the 'payloads' of the contract, representing the fields or properties of the business object. Depending on the configuration, some members may be optional or mandatory in a message.

- **Metadata**: WCF utilizes metadata to ensure consistency in data processing across communicating systems. 

- **Sharing Rules**: Data contracts allow you to specify global or service-specific sharing rules that dictate which data types are 'visible' to particular services.

- **Version Identifiers**: A data contract can incorporate versioning directives to manage changes in the data layout over time.

### Code Example: Data Contract

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
[DataContract]
public class EmployeeData
{
    [DataMember]
    public int EmployeeID { get; set; }

    [DataMember]
    public string Name { get; set; }

    [DataMember]
    public DateTime JoiningDate { get; set; }
}
```

In this example:
- `[DataContract]` decorates the class `EmployeeData` to indicate that it serves as a WCF data contract.
- Each public member (property in this case) of the class that needs to be included in the contract is adorned with `[DataMember]`.
<br>

## 7. What are the _ABCs_ of _WCF_?

**Windows Communication Foundation** (WCF) provides a unified programming model for building efficient, secure, and interoperable distributed applications. Here are the key concepts:

### Contracts

**Service Contract**, **Data Contract**, and **Message Contract** define the structure and behavior of WCF services.

#### Service Contract

- **Description**: Mentions the service's available operations.
- **WCF Marker**: Attributed with `[ServiceContract]`.
- **Example**:

  ```csharp
  [ServiceContract]
  public interface IMyService
  {
      [OperationContract]
      string MyOperation(string input);
  }
  ```

#### Data Contract

- **Description**: Specifies the data types used in the service operations.
- **WCF Marker**: Attributed with `[DataContract]`.
- **Example**:

  ```csharp
  [DataContract]
  public class CompositeType
  {
      bool boolValue = true;
      string stringValue = "Hello ";

      [DataMember]
      public bool BoolValue { get; set; }

      [DataMember]
      public string StringValue { get; set; }
  }
  ```

#### Message Contract

- **Description**: Customizes the messaging details such as the header and body structure.
- **WCF Marker**: Attributed with `[MessageContract]`.

### Bindings

A **binding** configures the way the WCF service communicates.

#### Key Attributes

- **Security Mode**: Set to `None`, `Transport`, or `Message`.
- **Transfer Mode**: Defines the message delivery method, either `Buffered` or `Streamed`.
- **Encoding**: Determines how the message data is encoded.

### Behaviors

**Behaviors** allow additional customizations, covering aspects such as metadata, validation, and error handling.

#### Key Types

- **ServiceBehavior**: Global settings for the entire service.
- **EndpointBehavior**: Tailors configuration at the individual endpoint level.

### Hosting

WCF services can be hosted in various environments, such as IIS, Windows services, or self-hosted within a managed application. The hosting method affects the service's availability, security, and lifecycle.

### Addressing

**Endpoints** are the service communication partners. Each one is identified by a unique address. The address can contain multiple parts, including the URI and the **binding type**. These components collectively determine the connection details of the endpoint.

### Communication

WCF supports two main communication patterns: **duplex** and **one-way**. The communication direction can either be **synchronous** or **asynchronous**, influencing how the client and server interact.

### WCF Service Lifecycle

WCF services progress through several stages from initialization to disposal. Understanding this lifecycle is essential for managing resources efficiently.

### Error Handling

WCF provides an error-handling mechanism, which clients can leverage to handle service exceptions. Techniques such as **fault contracts** can help services gracefully report errors to clients.
<br>

## 8. What _bindings_ are provided by _WCF_?

**Windows Communication Foundation** (WCF) offers a comprehensive set of bindings that cater to diverse communication requirements. Let's have a look at different bindings available in **WCF**.

### Key Binder Aspects

- **Binding Element**: Represents a configurable ingredient of a binding, such as transport, security, encoding, and more.
- **Binding Attribute**: Declares a connection-related aspect like the transport protocol, addressing mode, or security mode.
- **Standard Communication Protocols**: HTTP, TCP, Named Pipes, and MSMQ.

### Common Binding Attributes

- **Address**: Specifies the service's endpoint address.
- **Binding Configuration**: Refers to the name of the corresponding binding element in the configuration file.
- **Contract**: Identifies the service contract or interface.

### Core WCF Bindings

These are the essential bindings:

- **BasicHttpBinding**: Ideal for compatibility with non-WCF clients.
- **WSHttpBinding**: Offers comprehensive support for web services standards. Ideal for web-based scenarios that necessitate advanced capabilities like transactions and reliable messaging.
- **WSDualHttpBinding**: Matches the capabilities of `WSHttpBinding`, setting up duplex services over HTTP.
- **NetTcpBinding**: Optimized for communication tailored to a Windows domain, delivering faster speed and improved security.
- **NetNamedPipeBinding**: Suitable for communication within the same machine, best known for its simplicity and efficiency.

### Specialized WCF Bindings

These are less frequently used:

- **NetMsmqBinding**: Tailored for communication with queuing mechanisms, not limited to MSMQ.
- **NetPeerTcpBinding**: Configured for a **P2P network**, fostering intricate inter-node communication.
- **MEX Bindings**: Such as `mexHttpBinding` for metadata exchange, aiding in dynamically discovering services, and `mexTcpBinding` extends this capability specifically for TCP.

### IIS (Internet Information Services) Hosted Bindings

These are meant for WCF services hosted in IIS:

- **BasicHttpContextBinding**: Adapts to HTTP and offers dual-like message exchange patterns.
- **WSHttpContextBinding**: Extends BasicHttpContextBinding, supporting web services standards and advanced settings like secured conversation.
- **WS2007HttpContextBinding**: Much like WSHttpContextBinding but adheres strictly to service synchronization.

### Web Hosted Bindings

These are for services hosted in **Web environments**:

- **WebHttpBinding**: Tunes a service to the specifics of the HTTP protocol and the characteristics of RESTful services.
- **WebHttpRelayBinding**: A secure extension of WebHttpBinding, facilitating unhindered internet-based communication.
<br>

## 9. Explain _WCF endpoint_ and its components.

A **WCF endpoint** serves as the interface through which clients and services communicate. It is described by its **address**, **binding**, and **contract**, a combination known as the ABCs of a WCF endpoint.

### Components of a WCF Endpoint - ABCs

#### Address (A)

The **Address** defines the location where the service can be reached, typically expressed as a URI. This principle allows tremendous flexibility, enabling you to decouple the service from its physical location.

#### Binding (B)

The **Binding** specifies how the endpoint will communicate. It covers attributes such as the transport protocol, message encoding, and security requirements, giving you the power to customize communication per your application needs.

#### Contract (C)

The **Contract** sets the rules for communication, establishing what operations are available for the service. In a sense, it serves as an agreement between the client and the service, governing the messages they can exchange.

### Code Example: WCF Endpoint Configuration

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
// Define the contract
[ServiceContract]
public interface IMyService
{
    [OperationContract]
    string DoWork(string input);
}

// Set the address, binding, and contract in the service configuration
<system.serviceModel>
  <services>
    <service name="MyNamespace.MyService">
      <endpoint
          address="http://localhost:8000/MyService"
          binding="basicHttpBinding"
          contract="MyNamespace.IMyService" />
    </service>
  </services>
</system.serviceModel>
```

In the above example, the address is `http://localhost:8000/MyService`, the binding is `basicHttpBinding`, and the contract is defined by the `IMyService` interface.
<br>

## 10. How does _WCF_ ensure _interoperability_?

**Windows Communication Foundation** (WCF) is a powerful technology that caters to a range of platforms and protocols, ensuring smooth **interoperability** between different systems.

### Core Mechanisms for Interoperability

- **WS-I Basic Profile Compliance**: WCF is rooted in industry standards, allowing interconnection with various platforms and technologies.

- **Code Generation with WSDL**: WCF generates service contracts from WSDL, supporting compatibility with non-WCF clients.

- **WS-Security Standards Adherence**: By aligning with these standards, WCF enables secure data exchange across disparate systems.

- **Text Encoding Compatibility**: WCF supports textual message encodings, facilitating interoperability with non-binary API services.

- **Multiple Transport Protocols**: Straddling various transport mechanisms like HTTP, TCP, and MSMQ, WCF ensures agile platform-agnostic communication.

### WCF Interoperability Configuration Example

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
using System.ServiceModel;

[ServiceContract]
public interface IMyService
{
    [OperationContract]
    string GetData(int value);
}

public class MyService : IMyService
{
    public string GetData(int value)
    {
        return $"You entered: {value}";
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        using (var host = new ServiceHost(typeof(MyService), new Uri("http://localhost:8000/MyService")))
        {
            var endpoint = host.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(IMyService), new BasicHttpBinding(), "");
            endpoint.Behaviors.Add(new WebHttpBehavior());

            host.Open();

            Console.WriteLine("The service is ready.");
            Console.WriteLine("Press <Enter> to stop the service.");
            Console.ReadLine();

            host.Close();
        }
    }
}
```
<br>

## 11. What is the difference between a _WCF service_ and a _WCF client_?

Let me explain the main differences between a **WCF service** and a **WCF client**.

### Communication Direction

- **WCF Service**: Primarily responsible for handling incoming requests.
- **WCF Client**: Initiates the request and consumes the service.

### Hosting Responsibility

- **WCF Service**: The service can be self-hosted within an application or hosted in several ways, including IIS, Windows Activation Service, or a managed Windows service.
- **WCF Client**: No inherent hosting. The client is typically part of a different application or system that consumes the service.

### Endpoint Configuration

- **WCF Service**: The service defines, configures, and publishes endpoints, specifying aspects such as binding, address, and behaviors.
- **WCF Client**: The client, when consuming the service, needs to be aware of the service's endpoints, which are typically configured in the client's configuration.

### Security Role

- **WCF Service**: It's responsible for defining the security mechanisms, ranging from transport-level (such as SSL) and message-level security (e.g., encryption, digital signatures) to programmatic means like custom validators.
- **WCF Client**: While it can define its own security requirements, it also needs to adhere to the security mechanisms defined by the service, such as providing credentials or signatures as per the service's expectations.

### Communication Layer

- **WCF Service**: Handles communication with clients, which may or may not use the WCF framework. This is seamless because both service and clients are WCF-aware.
- **WCF Client**: Initiates the communication using the WCF service's contract (interface) and can interact with the service using the defined communication patterns such as one-way, request-reply, or duplex. The WCF client can be another WCF service, a WCF application, or a custom WCF client.
<br>

## 12. Describe _WCF's support for RESTful services_.

**WCF's RESTful Service** support Boston has become a popular choice for APIs with its simplified design.

### WCF and REST

WCF introduces the `WebHttpBinding` that enables operations through several HTTP verbs like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

By using `WebGet`, `WebInvoke`, and the `EnableWebScript` behavior, WCF can be made to work with traditional web constructs such as URIs and HTTP verbs.

### Advantages

- **Simplicity**: REST requires fewer protocols such as **HTTP and JSON**.

- **Scalability**: REST systems can offer high scalability due to the stateless nature of the protocols.

- **Flexibility**: RESTful methods, or "verbs", used in WCF are a subset of all HTTP methods, providing a focused resource-management mechanism.

### Code Example: RESTful WCF Service

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
[ServiceContract]
public interface IMyService
{
    [OperationContract]
    [WebInvoke(Method = "POST", UriTemplate = "/data", ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]
    Data AddData(Data data);

    [OperationContract]
    [WebGet(UriTemplate = "/data/{id}", ResponseFormat = WebMessageFormat.Json)]
    Data GetData(string id);
}

public class MyService : IMyService
{
    public Data AddData(Data data) { /* Implementation */ }
    public Data GetData(string id) { /* Implementation */ }
}

public class Data
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```
<br>

## 13. How is _security implemented in WCF_?

**WCF** encompasses several **security** mechanisms, ensuring data integrity, confidentiality, and availability.

### Mutual Authentication

Both the service and the client validate each other's credentials. This process can involve several **authentication methods**, such as Windows, username/password, or certificates.

### Data Encryption

WCF supports end-to-end **encryption** using various mechanisms, such as SSL/TLS or message-level encryption. This ensures that data remains secure in transit.

### Authorization

WCF validates **access rights** based on the identity of the client. You can establish authorization rules at the operation and resource levels, leveraging role-based permissions.

### Service Non-repudiation

To prevent services from denying performing an operation, WCF uses service non-repudiation, ensuring **data integrity**. This mechanism requires services to sign messages, using, for instance, WS-Security.

### Message Integrity

WCF verifies that the **data** in the message hasn't been tampered with by using digital signatures. The message-level integrity check ensures that both the sender and the receiver can trust the message.

### Firewalls and Port Configurations

For enhanced network **security**, WCF is designed to be firewall-friendly. The default port for HTTP is 80, while for HTTPS, it's 443.

### Throttling

Throttling helps in **avoiding service abuse** or excessive resource consumption by limiting the number of concurrent calls, sessions, or users.

### Error Handling and Auditing

WCF's security mechanisms include robust **error handling** and **auditing** capabilities, enabling organizations to track potential security issues and respond to them effectively.

### Data Privacy

WCF facilitates data privacy, ensuring that the exchanged **messages** and any attached credentials are not exposed in system logs or other records.
<br>

## 14. What do you understand by _multiple bindings in WCF_?

**Multiple Bindings** in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) allow for diverse communication configurations beyond what a single binding protocol can offer.

It comes in handy when different communication options are required.

For instance, ```netTcpBinding``` is optimized for high performance on a local network, while ```basicHttpBinding``` targets interoperability over HTTP.

### How Can You Define a Service with Multiple Bindings?

WCF services can have multiple endpoints, each using different bindings.
Here's an example from the `Web.config` file:

```xml
<services>
  <service name="YourService">
    <endpoint address="basicHttp" binding="basicHttpBinding"
              contract="IYourService" />
    <endpoint address="netTcp" binding="netTcpBinding"
              contract="IYourService" />
  </service>
</services>
```

You can also set this up programmatically.

### Core Bindings in WCF

WCF offers **core bindings**, each targeting distinct communication scenarios. These bindings serve as the foundation for tailored and more specialized configurations.

#### Core Binding Options

1. **Basic Bindings**:
   - BasicHttpBinding: For interop with ASMX services and HTML clients.

2. **Security-Oriented Bindings**:
   - WSHttpBinding: For secure, reliable sessions over a variety of transport options.
   - WSDualHttpBinding: Similar to `WSHttpBinding` but with two-way communication across firewalls.

3. **TCP-Optimized Bindings**:
   - NetTcpBinding: For fast, secure communication within a trusted environment.

4. **Web-Oriented Bindings**:
   - WebHttpBinding: For JSON and REST communication.

5. **Specialized Bindings**:
   - NetNamedPipeBinding: Fast, secure communication within the same computer using named pipes.
   - NetMsmqBinding: Asynchronous, loosely coupled communication to MSMQ queues.

## 15. Can you explain the role of _interfaces_ in _WCF_?

**WCF** heavily leverages **interfaces**. By defining contracts for services, WCF allows clear separation between service implementation and service description.

- Service contracts outline service operations.
- Data contracts specify data structures used in service operations.
  
### Service Contracts

A service contract is a direct extension of the `IServiceContract` interface. It elaborates on:

- **Operations**: The methods offered by the service.
- **One-way or Request-Reply Semantics**: Defines whether a method requires a **response**.

### Data Contracts

A data contract describes how complex types or messages should be formatted for communication between the client and the service. The shared data definition is represented through an interface that derives from the `IDataContract` interface.

### Code Example: WCF Interfaces

Here is the C# code:

```csharp
[ServiceContract]
public interface ICalculatorService
{
    [OperationContract]
    int Add(int a, int b);

    [OperationContract]
    int Divide(int numerator, int denominator);

    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void StartLongOperation();
}

[DataContract]
public interface IComplexData
{
    [DataMember]
    string Name { get; set; }

    [DataMember]
    int Value { get; set; }
}
```
